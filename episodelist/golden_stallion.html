Upon getting there, he was caught by a guard, completed the objective, and went up. By ascending he unintentionally decided the outcome of the run. In the Heart Room he was taken out of the temple, and his partner followed his steps. The Heart Room and the Observatory both did not open towards the Shrine, and after a giant loop, the team was back on the bottom floor. She made it to the Dark Forest before time expired. If it made the team feel any better, I believe they were the only players ever to use all three doors leading left from the Pit of Despair (in any season). I'd like to spend a short time now talking about a peculiarity of this episode. During the time when Olmec descibed the rooms of the temple, he called the Heart Room Medusa's Lair, even though the room had not been introduced into the temple yet. I imagine he probably had heard of a layout change and mixed up the two names. What do you think?", "Der Kommissar", "Here\'s one of those episodes where a vertical trek from the room at the bottom of the temple's central shaft ruins the team's chances of victory. I was glad to see that the team tried doors leading toward the artifact, but they just didn\'t have good luck. They seemed like pretty smart players, and had they not taken their vertical detour from the Throne Room, chances are the team could have reached the artifact, and maybe even achieved a victory.");
