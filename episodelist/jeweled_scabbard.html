Even then, this was an exciting episode, especially in the temple games. After winning the second game and tying the third, the Blue Barracudas joined the Green Monkeys in the tiebreaker. After the Green Monkeys rung in, Kirk accedentally called on the Barracudas but quickly realized his error. The Monkeys then explained the answer in such detail that Olmec shouted, \"That is ABSOLUTELY correct!\" The Green Monkeys won themselves a very pleasant vacation to Jamaica, with nearly a half minute to spare. Kirk had a ton of character in this episode, especially in the first half. It's what made the episode even more enjoyable.","Michael Hackney","The Temple Run itself may have been easy (methinks the production folk felt charitable on this taping day), but this episode also featured perhaps the worst Temple Game in show history. It was the team game where they take both team members, have them turn their backs to each other, then attach them by a wire. One team members picks up an object, then throws it onto a wooden plank, where the other team member has to catch it, and place it in a large bin. In this case, the first player was tossing \"cannonballs\" (really, they were kickballs), and the second player had to catch them. \"Cannonballs\" went flying all over place, in addition to being dropped constantly. When it came time for Kirk to count the \"cannonballs\" in the bin, his job was easy: neither team managed to put a \"cannonball\" into their bin! Lousiness. Sheer lousiness. And pathetic teamwork on both parts.", "Dave Miller", "The third game was difficult, but don't blame it on the kids. The balls they usually use are boulder shaped, these were kickballs, they bounced way too far out of the reach of the kids. And how about the first temple game the score was outrageous both players did outstanding. What I'm most disappointed about is neither one of the reviews manage to talk about the passion of the green monkeys. This team may have been the two most excited indivuals I have ever seen. They cared so much and showed so much passion and desire to win. And when you see the male contestant come out you see the girl chop her feet in excitment and then leap into the boys arms. These two were my favorite contestants of all time.");
