They traveled around South America, through Panama, and across Native American territory and Death Valley. By 1850, most of the gold in California was gone.

First off, Kirk obviously miscounted the first Temple Game; the Silver Snakes managed to get five gold pieces, and not the four that he counted. During the second game, Kirk kept mentioning the Snakes' difficulty to climb up the walls, because as he explained, \"that's the problem, the Snakes don't have any feet!\" Their opposition was the Blue Barracudas, (also lacking feet, if you didn't catch the irony). Following the Temple Games was the Temple Run, which actually gave us a moment to take a deep breath before laughing out loud again.<p>By asking the team their strategy before the run started, Kirk reassured us of the great teamwork between the two players. It was this teamwork that turned out to be the key to their success. In the Throne Room the frontrunner Damian was taken out; the second player, Jennifer, then progressed a full six rooms and got to the artifact. Though there were many funny things in this episode, the funniest of all was the event that happened in the last seconds of the run. Upon exiting the temple for the win, Jennifer took a sharp turn and slipped on the floor of the studio before crossing the temple gate.<p>During the run, Kirk managed more incorrect room names than any other episode. He called rooms by names like \"The Ledge of Sighs,\" \"The Temple of the Ancient Kings,\" and his classic \"The Center of the Room.\" In addition to all of this, he also game the players some hilarious advice during the run. When Jennifer was in the Room of the Golden Idols, Kirk told her to \"hug an idol.\" In the Shrine, he said \"first things first when you're assembling a monkey, huh?\" This was simply a hilarious episode from beginning to end, but it was also memorable for its exciting temple run.","Mike Lowrey","This was one of the most exciting temple runs of the first season. The frontrunner was taken out of the temple less than a minute into the run so it became the second runner's turn rather quickly. She completed the room objectives with little or no problem. She didn't take any shortcuts but it didn't matter. She grabbed the map and fell as she approached the temple gate but got up and won the grand prize. As a side note, you can clearly see the temple guard when the second runner exits through the Cave of Sighs.");
