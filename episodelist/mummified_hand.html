As Nachmed tried to pick the sculpture up, the hand of the mummy broke off and Nachmed ran away. Still with the hand, the two brothers ran. The mummy still searches for its lost hand.

The frontrunner dropped her pendant after letting go of the pendulum rope. In the Tomb of the Headless Kings, she got caught, and because of the lack of her pendant, the second teammate had to take over. He found the pendant in the corner of the Pit of the Pendulum (who knows how it got there) and then took an alternate route, only to be caught by two temple guards with nearly a minute to go. If they were not caught by the three temple guards, they most probably would have made it to the artifact, and possibly have had a close finish.","Der Kommissar","This was one of the more unusual Temple Runs. The frontrunner lost her pendant in the Pit of the Pendulum (and by lost it, I mean she DROPPED it.) In the Tomb Of Headless Kings, she was removed from the Temple due to her lack of a pendant. Her partner found the pendant she dropped, but he then made the mistake that unintentionally decided the outcome of the run - He took an alternate route. This is something you NEVER do if you have less than two pendants, and he quickly found out why. In the Room of the Secret Password, a third Temple Guard put a premature end to this Run. Had the second runner stuck to the frontrunner's path, the doors in the Tomb would have opened upwards to the Chamber Of The Sacred Markers, where the other half pendant was hidden. A victory would have been likely if he'd taken that path instead of the one he created on his own.");
