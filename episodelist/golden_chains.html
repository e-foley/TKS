Justin couldn't figure out how to open the treasure chest, and this distracted him completely from his objective in the temple. He ran around in a loop before finally regaining his wits and climbing down to the Room of Harmonic Convergence. After opening the door, he decided to leisurely walk to the Tomb of Ancient Kings. He found the key and put it on the metallic plate leading upwards, but the door didn't open. Time ran out immediately afterwards.","Der Kommissar","This temple run went pretty well, at first, but had a disappointing outcome. Jennifer went through the temple pretty fast until she was removed by a guard in the Treasure Room, [a single room from the artifact.] Justin, the second runner, was slow-witted, and this cost the team dearly. First and foremost, rather than running straight up to the Gargoyle room, he followed his partner's steps through the Cave Of Sighs (a mistake players make much too often.) The Treasure Room/Shrine doors wouldn't open, so he went in a triangular loop between that room, the Observatory, and the Heart Room. At one point he tried climbing down through the treasure chest, but it either didn't open or he didn't do the objective right. Once he got his act together, he went into the room of Harmonic Convergence and worked his way over. Time ran out when he was in the Tomb Of Ancient Kings, right below the artifact. Side note: In Olmec's pre-temple run summary, the Well bucket doesn't ascend like it normally does.");
