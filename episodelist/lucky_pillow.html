The Blue Barracudas as a team were a great pair, excelling at the Steps of Knowledge and winning the Temple Games (with a single pendant), but in the end, it was only one Blue Barracuda that made the difference. Little did she know, Missy would become the first contestant to overcome the difficulties of retrieving an artifact from the central room of the temple. She raced past the gates and slid down the slide into the Ledges. From here, she followed the bottom path all the way to the Dark Forest, where she immediately went upwards, and continued along the top floor directly to the artifact. She sped into Medusa's Lair, grabbed the Pillow, and darted back out, climbing past the Pit and through the Ledges until she raced up the final path behind Olmec, and then down the stairs to record the incredible solo win with twenty whole seconds to spare. After finishing the run, she became so joyous that she nearly cried, hugging her partner and Kirk as a celebration for her win. All her nervous energy throughout the show paid off! Kirk's enthusiasm towards the temple run was additionally quite memorable. Missy deserved her trip to Jamaica.","Der Kommissar","Missy entered the temple and took the low road to the Dark Forest. From there, she used the key to get up to the Shrine, and went straight into Medusa's Lair. She got the pillow and escaped with twenty seconds to spare! And to believe, she was nervous throughout the course of the show... Side Note: Missy was the first player to ever retrieve an artifact from the center room of the temple.");
