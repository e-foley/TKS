This was the worst temple run ever taped.", "Der Kommissar", "If I had to pick an absolute worst temple run of all time, the honor would have to go to this episode. Many runs in Season One feature one smart player and one stupid player, but this episode featured a pair of stupid players that had absolutely no idea what they were doing! They only covered four rooms in three minutes - a record low for the show (admittedly, the team in Elizabeth I's Golden Ship also only covered four rooms, but they had a valid excuse - they got caught by three temple guards.) If it makes the players feel any better, they're one of the few teams in the history of the show to use both crawl tubes connecting the Cave Of Sighs to the Pit - that's the only good thing I can say about this run.");
