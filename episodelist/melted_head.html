One day, Napoleon Bonaparte came to get a sculpture done. While working on a bust of Napoleon, she plotted her escape. When she was finished, she put the bust over her head and hopped the next taxi. As they kept going, the wax bust over Marie's head began to melt due to the heat of the sun. The driver got concerned, and Marie hopped off the taxi before he could protest. She then got on a ship to England where she set up her new Wax Museum and the melted head made its way to the temple. The Melted Head could be found in the Quicksand Bog.";

Usually the temple is designed so that the players have little choice, but things were different when all three doors opened from the Pit of the Pendulum. Unfortunately, the frontrunner decided to take the bottom route, which was simply a detour of two rooms to make it to the King's Storeroom (where a door already opened to). After the frontrunner was taken out in the Room of the Ancient Warriors, the partner made a smart move and went directly to the King's Storeroom, but did not have enough time to make it all the way to the artifact. The Silver Monkey was completed just as time ran out.");
