After taking the ladder downwards, she raced through the bottom floor of the temple and then up to the Nest, caught by only a temple spirit in the Dark Forest. After grabbing the Horseshoe with 1:25 to go, she zipped out of the temple. Her partner, Matt, only needed to watch as she brought out the artifact with fifty-three seconds to spare. Kirk called the team \"The Comeback Kids\" because they came back crossing the Moat, and they came back in the Temple Games. One pendant was plenty enough for the team to \"come back\" in the temple run as well.", "Der Kommissar", "This is one of the best temple runs of all time, in my opinion. Paula starts by taking the low road, and advanced through the Pit and into the Heart Room (this is one of the only Season Two episodes that has it.) She then goes to the bottom of the Temple and works her way over, encountering a Temple Spirit in the Dark Forest when she is near the breakable wall. Finally, she breaks the wall and takes the Mine Shaft elevator up to the Vipers\' Nest. She gets the Horseshoe and makes a mad dash across the upper level of the Temple. After jumping into the Pit and climbing through the Ledges, she escapes with roughly fifty-three seconds to spare.","Jared Alexander","I have to say I really underestimated Paula after her performance during the Moat crossing, but she soon proved me wrong. Paula went into the Ledges at a moderately fast pace then climbed up the wall to the Heart Room. She then descended to the Heart Room and crawled into the Swamp. After the Swamp, Paula went into the Dark Forest where she got caught by a temple guard (spirit). She then broke through the wall and ascended in the slow slow Mine Shaft elevator. She then grabbed the horseshoe in the Vipers\' Nest with about 1:20 and raced through the top floor like she only had 10 seconds left. She then jumped back into the Pit and climbed back through the Ledges and won with 53 seconds to go. Paula had to be one of the smartest female contestants ever to be on the show because she climbed up the Pit and tried the door from the Heart Room to the King\'s Storeroom before descending into the Throne Room. She also probably knew that if she tried to go up in the other rooms it would be harder. Side notes, this is the only episode in Season 2 which a contestant goes into the Throne Room and actually does not sit on the throne to open the door, and did anyone else notice how easy the combination of rooms was in this temple run?");
