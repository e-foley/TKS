Both players ran up and down between the Observatory and the Throne Room before realizing that there was a second exit. Even after correcting their flaw and progressing, they found that both doors to the Tomb of Ancient Kings failed to open. The production crew probably expected a bit too much out of the players in this run.", "Der Kommissar", "This was the first episode of Legends ever recorded, and because of it, the producers expected WAY too much out of the players. The layout was simply brutal. Both players were forced to run up and down the center shaft of the temple, only to encounter dead end after dead end. Even once the players realized that the door into the Swamp from the Throne Room opened, neither one of the doors to the Tomb of Ancient Kings opened! Time expired shortly after. On a side note, some of the reasons I can tell that this was the first episode ever recorded include the fact that the players introduce themselves by first AND LAST names in the Temple Games, Kirk miscounting the first Temple Game, Dee Baker's voice being a little deeper and slower than normal (as HIMSELF, NOT as Olmec), and, of course, the wildly difficult Temple layout. Also, the Temple Run music ends in a slightly off key place - NOT where it normally ends. As a final note, the Swamp being a dead end probably meant that the doors leading upward WOULD have opened - and we NEVER see one of them open upward in the entire first season.", "Ian Fisne", "In the Season 1 Steps of Knowledge, the third choice to a question would frequently be a 'joke' answer. This episode features the dumbest response in the Steps of Knowledge EVER. Olmec asked, \"Which of these men was a friend of Wild Bill and later fought a battle at Little Bighorn - General Grant, General Custer, or Colonel Sanders?\" The Silver Snakes stomp in and the male contestant responds, \"Colonel Sanders!\" (Colonel Sanders founded KFC!) As Olmec says \"incorrect\", the audience starts laughing, a dumbfounded Kirk goes \"ohhh....Green Monkeys?\" The Green Monkeys gave the correct response (General Custer), and joined the Orange Iguanas on the bottom step. As Kirk joins the teams, the female Silver Snake looks like she'd rather be anywhere else in the world! Classic. On a second note, this temple run was extremely difficult not only because of the layout, but because of the Throne Room's lighting. The room was so poorly lit that I can't blame the Orange Iguanas for not seeing the door to the Swamp was open a crack.");
