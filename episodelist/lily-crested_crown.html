It wasn't easy, because he and his army were pushed back to a river called The Rhine. The King sent out a messenger stating that he was trapped and could not escape. Minutes later when soldiers attacked, Clovis's army panicked. Clovis decided to cross the river, but the army complained about drowning. Clovis ignored them, and they crossed the river without sinking. The German's were astonished, they ran. Clovis knew the water was shallow with the lilies at the bottom. So Clovis changed his embroidery on his crown from toads to lilies. The Lily-Crested Crown could be found in The Quicksand Bog.";

The frontrunner, Katie, darted into the temple with a head start, and hesitantly pulled the books from the skeleton in the Crypt, before racing on into the Pit of the Pendulum. This seemed to be a pattern through her run--she always had some difficulty or hesitancy completing the objectives, but sprinted when running between rooms. She smashed the pots, inserted the key, and eventually found her way out of the Storeroom, then descended into the Chamber, where she not only met a temple guard, but also decided the run's outcome. She took a very long time searching for the fourth symbol in the Chamber, even to the point of feeling the walls for any protrusions. She was removed by a second temple guard two rooms later. Judge raced in, and followed his partner's footprins to the Shrine, but was not quite able to assemble the monkey in time.<p>This temple, as I said earlier, was a tricky design, first of all because Katie was given only one choice in the run--her choice between entering the Ledges or the Crypt first. Secondly, the crew arranged the opened doors in a way I don't recall them doing in any other episode. When Katie hit the pendulum in the Pit, only the Storeroom door opened, yet when she completed (finally) the Chamber's objective, the door connecting that room to the Pit clearly opened. The second player should have chosen this shortened route, but didn't. Either way, it was unlikely the team would have won, as it is doubtful the crew would have allowed direct access to the Quicksand Bog from the Shrine. ");
