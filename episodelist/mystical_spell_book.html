However, one day the Emperor's beloved wife Ling Ling passed away suddenly. Upon hearing of this, Che summoned his wizard, and ordered him to use his magic to bring Ling Ling back to life. The wizard responded that the feat was impossible, that as Emperor he could marry any woman in the land, and even suggested that he mary Ling's sister Ring Ling. Che responded that he would not remarry, and that the wizard had just 1 day to produce Ling Ling or be done away with. At this, the wizard retreated back into his cave to consult his mystical spell book, but couldn't find a cure for death in it. Then he got an idea, and the next day he used the art of Shadow Theater to trick the Emperor into thinking Ling Ling was back. The emperor was comforted so much by this, that he promoted the wizard to the position of Grand Vizier. The Mystical Spell Book could be found in the Room of the Secret Password.";

This temple design was one of those. The side door of the Crypt didn't open after Jared pulled all three books, so he was forced to traverse downwards into the Ledges. Here, only the bottom door leading to the Pit of the Pendulum opened. As he progressed, he was forced to push the column down with his own hands to continue. After he did this, the door to the Tomb of the Headless Kings did not open, so he climbed up the wall and took the stairway to the King's Storeroom. He then followed the top path to the Shrine. After he assembled the monkey, the door directly to the Room of the Secret Password did not open, so he took the ladder down to the Dark Forest. He had a moment of hesitation, but he smashed through the wall to the Quicksand Bog and got caught by his second temple guard. His partner, Katie, followed exactly where her partner went, and had about forty seconds to make some progress. She made a smart move and took the ladder from the Shrine to the Quicksand Bog, but time ran out before she could exit the room. I really wanted to see this team win; It's too bad that they came up short.");
