Only to encounter a third temple guard. The guard's imposing figure terrified him right out of the temple! If the team had the other half pendant, they would have had a good chance of victory.", "Der Kommissar", "Not a single Legends player ever managed to make it to an artifact hidden in the Swamp, but the second runner in this run came the closest. Both players moved through the temple at a good speed, but they weren't able to find the other half pendant. When the second runner entered the Tomb, he was just one room away from the artifact. But it was at this point that a third guard emerged - who scared him right out of the Temple! What a shame. If the team had the other half pendant, or if they'd started in the Gargoyle room instead of the Cave, they would have had a high chance of victory.");
