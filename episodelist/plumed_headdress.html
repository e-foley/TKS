The rooms that the teams had to go through were the toughest the temple offered, so it was an accomplishment in its own right to have progressed so far.", "Der Kommissar", "The frontrunner in this temple run was very fast, but sadly, he was removed from the temple in the King's Storeroom after traversing the central shaft (the layout was VERY difficult in this temple run in that they were forced to scale the entire central shaft.) The second runner moved much too slowly. Although she found the half pendant at the entrance to the Laser Light Room, it made no difference. Time expired just as she was jamming the head on the Silver Monkey.");
