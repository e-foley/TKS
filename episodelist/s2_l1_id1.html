This was a pretty average episode. The frontrunner got taken out in the King's Storeroom, and then his partner followed his footsteps up to that point. However, after she found the key and placed it in the correct pedestal, she retreated to the Observatory, where she wasted much unnecessary time. After finding her bearings, she progressed to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey just as time ran out. This episode was quite obviously taped early in the second season for a few noticable reasons. First of all, the camerawork was much sloppier than usual, and Kirk could barely keep from announcing the temple games himself. ("And the first temple game is... Olmec, tell us about it.")

<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
This was a pretty typical Legends loss - enough said. The second runner wasted a good deal of time by unnecessarily retreating back to the Observatory from the King's Storeroom, and this cost the team their chance of victory. It's a shame they didn't get further, because they had both pendants! As a final note, this was the first episode recorded of Season Two. This is identifiable by the fact that the Heart Room is present, the camerawork is very sloppy (watch when the first runner gets taken out of the Temple to see what I mean), and Kirk's Temple Game introduction is VERY similar to that of Season One.<p align=left>

<i>Aaron F.</i>:
Judging from a few noticeable facts you could tell this was may have been the first episode in Season 2. One noticeable factor was Kirk did not light up the gong at the Moat. The spotters didn’t have the normal scoreboard stands, your guess is as good as mine, but who cares? back to the temple run. Jonathan (the frontrunner) was slow and didn’t have a clue of what he was doing, he was taken out at the King's Storeroom. Then his partner made an extremely stupid mistake kind of like the Dead Man’s Hand episode. She kept going backwards (hello, you're supposed to move forward). Well, time ran out soon after. Kirk said, "you blazed through it all." Yeah right!
