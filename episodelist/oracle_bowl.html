The fortune-teller told him that if he attacked the Persians, a great empire would be destroyed. Croesus went home and promptly attacked Persia. The battle raged for 14 days. But when it was over, Croesus had lost. By attacking the Persians, he had destroyed a great empire... His own. Years later, the Temple of Delphi was abandoned and everything inside was lost including the fortune-teller's bowl. The Oracle Bowl could be found in The Observatory.";

He dead-ended at the end of the Troubled Bridge, but quickly retraced his steps and climbed down to the Cave of Sighs. He was eventually taken out in the Swamp. The second player... It would be a lie to say she knew what she was doing. She did not pay attention to where her partner had gone, and, as a consequence, wasted time looking for an opened door in each room. After sluggishly making it to the Dungeon, she took the ladder up to the Cove, where she spent the last thirty-or-so seconds of the run learning the room's objective. Just as she put the torch in the correct pedestal, time ran out.","Der Kommissar","The frontrunner in this run was quite fast and intelligent. He tried doors leading toward the artifact, but sadly, was removed just a minute into the run by a Temple Guard in the Swamp. And then, in came the second runner. This girl was just pathetic! Not only did the go up to the Gargoyle room only to be forced back down to the Cave Of Sighs, it also took her a good thirty seconds to find the door to the Wheel Room in the Cave! In the Tomb Of Ancient Kings, she found the key, but didn't try using it on the door to the Shrine Of The Silver Monkey. Instead, she broke through the wall (which she didn't push on hard enough at first, believe it or not.) In the Dungeon, she took the Cove ladder, NOT the Shrine ladder. She wasted the last thirty seconds or so of the run in the Pirates' Cove, trying to figure out how to open the door to the Shrine. Time expired as soon as she completed the room objective.");
