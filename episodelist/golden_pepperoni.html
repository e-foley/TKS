Being the wife of 1 French King, and mother of 3 others, she managed to rule over France for the vast majority of her life. She had a love of castles, having many built for her in her lifetime. After finishing her latest castle in the heart of France, Catherine summoned her Royal Psychic, The Great Linguini. She complained to him about a dream where she was chased around her new castle, and asked what Linguini thought of this. He responded that he thought Catherine's dream was brought on by eating too much pepperoni late at night, that he was a Psychic & not a Psychologist, and that if she continued to live there, she'd be haunted by bad dreams The next day, Catherine had the new castle completely demolished, and later sent a golden pepperoni to Linguini as a token of thanks when her bad dreams had stopped. The pepperoni was later stolen after Linguini's death. The Golden Pepperoni of Catherine de' Medici could be found in the Room of the Secret Password.";

As he passed through the Pit he signaled his partner the location of the half-pendant. Unfortunately, he was taken out not soon after, unrolling the red carpet for one of the most--how to say--slow-witted contestants on the show. She did not pass through the rooms too quickly, and went past the half pendant her partner had signaled her, before realizing that she had passed it. Her true slow-wittedness came in the last few seconds of the run. She completed the silver monkey with four seconds to go, and raced into the Room of the Secret Password, clear past the artifact, and then went down the elevator! Time expired shortly after.", "Der Kommissar", "The second runner in this temple run was one of the most slow-witted contestants in the show's history, and this would cost the team dearly. After passing up her half pendant, she goes back for it - this seems smart, but it costs them time. In the King's Storeroom, she tries pushing the buttons before she actually realizes what she needs to do. After assembling the Silver Monkey, she enters the Secret Password room. The Pepperoni is within arm's length. But NO! For some reason we will never know, she passes up the Pepperoni and gets in the elevator to the Mine Shaft. What a waste. Side Notes: Kirk accidentally calls the Mandarin Hand Room Medusa's Lair at one point in this run. Also, Kirk yelling out \"Get the Pepperoni!\" was pretty funny, too, as were his post-run comments.","Michael Hackney","The girl is just lucky Chris fell to his knees when she passed up the pepperoni. A competitive person (i.e. me) would've died on the spot from shock!");
