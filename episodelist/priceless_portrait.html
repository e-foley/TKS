Upon attending an exhibit of Impressionist painters, he decided to take up Impressionism as a hobby. This eventually led him to quit his job to peruse painting full time and move to the island of Tahiti. There he painted the natives using the bright, primitive colors of their land. He even gave a young girl a portrait that he had done of her, which her family kept for generations. The Priceless Portrait could be found in the Laser Light Room.";

The frontrunner, Jim, got taken out in less than half a minute in the Room of the Mandarin Hand, so it became Kristen's turn quite quickly. She followed his path to the Room of the Mandarin Hand, but then turned around and went backwards! After a bit of delay, she recovered the second half of her pendant which was resting on the Observatory's actuator. She then took an alternate route and progressed upwards, only to encounter the team's third guard. Following this, she went across the top floor to the Shrine, took the ladder down, and passed through the Dark Forest and the Jester's Court very quickly. With about fifteen or so seconds left, she grabbed the artifact, but on her way out, she had trouble climbing through the passages, and time ran out in the Ledges where \"she would be lost and won't get out,\" according to Kirk Fogg. On a different note, Olmec is famous for his special pronunciation of \"The Shrine of the Silver Monkey.\" The funniest part of this episode is that Olmec's voice cracked badly when he said it. I'm fairly surprised it was not edited out!","Der Kommissar","Jim started off in the Crypt, where a guard took his pendant almost instantly. He went straight across to the Mandarin Hand room, where another guard removed him from the temple. Kristen hesitated once she reached the site of her partner's removal, and went back to the pit. On the Observatory door actuator, she found the other half of her pendant. She needed it - A temple guard was waiting in the Observatory. From there, she went at a pretty medium pace to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, and then went down to the Dark Forest. She came back along the bottom floor with the time running low. In the last few seconds of the run, she grabbed the portrait and entered the crawl tube to the Ledges, but due to her earlier hesitation, didn't have time to escape from the temple with it.","Bob Maibaum","Isn't it ironic that a person who's hobby is painting was the one to lay hands on the artifact?");
