Richard had been trying to capture the city of Acre (in present day Israel), but the city held fast while Saladin's forces attacked Richard from behind. Acre eventually surrendered to the exhausted forces of Richard. After this, Saladin and Richard came face to face. Saladin gave Richard his most favorite jewel, the Star of Saladin. Richard accepted the gift, thanked Saladin, and they both signed a treaty which ended the war. Richard then set out for England, but the Star was stolen from him along the way. The Star of Sultan Saladin could be found in the Observatory.";

The girl tried doors leading toward the artifact (usually with disappointing results), but she knew what she was doing. She got the Star and escaped from the temple in just 2:33. Solo runs don't get much better than this one.","Doug E. Fresh","This was the first solo win in Legends history, and it was well earned. Leah hardly ever hesitated and got the Star out with twenty-seven seconds left. Side note: when Leah was exiting the Cave of Sighs, you can see a temple guard in the corner of the cave. This proves that Leah made a good choice in starting path because if she had started in the cave, she would've been taken out of the temple with a guard waiting for her in the Tomb of the Ancient Kings. This win is a personal favorite of mine.");
