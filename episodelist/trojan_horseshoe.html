Paris, Prince of Troy decided to marry a woman named Helen, who was already married to the Greek King Menelaus of Sparta. Enraged at the taking of his queen, Menelaus engaged in a 10-year long war with Troy. Near the end of the war, a smart Greek citizen proposed that Menelaus build a hollow horse statue, fill it with warriors, leave it outside Troy as a gift, and pretend to sail away. Then after the Trojans accept the gift, the Greek warriors could come out at night, open the doors to the city of Troy, and let the Greek army in to destroy it. This plan worked, ending the war. The Trojan Horseshoe could be found in the Tomb of the Ancient Kings.";
