The frontrunner was forced to zig-zag up and down at the beginning of the run, which cost the team some time. When the frontrunner reached the pendulum rope, she did not know how to get on. She made a miserable attempt, swung, and fell from the pendulum before it could reach the column. She wasted some time trying to climb back up the walls to try again before she realized she could just push over the column with her hands and continue. This is one of the few episodes where a player pushes over the column and does not use the pendulum to do so. The frontrunner found her second temple guard in the Quicksand bog, and her partner then had to retrace her steps with under a minute to go. He made it to the Pharaoh's Secret Passage when time ran out, having completed no room objectives. Note: The second player gained access to the door leading from the Dark Forest to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, but did not use it to ascend.", "Ian Fisne", "The first player pointed out the half-pendant to her partner; it was in the Jester's Court on the top button of the middle wall painting. (You have to look closely to see it; look for the black hanging strap and then the moon-shaped half pendant piece below it.) I don't think the second partner saw her signaling, plus after she opened up the room it became dark, he wouldn't have seen his half-pendant anyway. Unfortunately, even if the players had sped up more, the second runner probably still would have been taken out by the third guard; without that half-pendant, the only way the Green Monkeys could have won was if the third guard was in the King's Storeroom, and the door from the Ancient Warriors room to the Chamber opened. This was a tough layout, and, without two pendants, it ultimately came down to luck. To the best of my knowledge, this was the only time a half-pendant was hidden in the Jester's Court.","Doug E. Fresh","I feel that this run is underrated in terms of how hard the layout was, and this Green Monkeys team was not fit enough for such a hard layout. The frontrunner was forced to enter both starting rooms, and neither of them had a temple guard. She then encountered a guard in the Tomb of the Headless Kings and a guard in the Quicksand Bog. The half pendant was in the Jesters’ Court and because it was so dark in that room, the second runner had like no chance to find it. He ran out of time in the Pharaoh’s Secret Passage, but I don’t think it would’ve mattered anyway because triple guard capture was very likely to happen (unless for some odd reason the third guard was in the King’s Storeroom or if it was in the wrong suit of armor in the Room of the Ancient Warriors). This was without a doubt one of the hardest layouts in the show’s history.");
