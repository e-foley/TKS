The caliph reviewed the prisoners and one of the guards told one of them that they need to be imprisoned for 10 years. Then, the caliph, who was behind the curtain, said to free him. Ahmad Baba stepped forward and told the caliph to show himself. He didn't want to, but Ahmad Baba said that it must've been lonely being behind that curtain for so long. The caliph agreed and gave Ahmad his very tall turban and set him free. The Very Tall Turban could be found in the Observatory.";

However, unlike the Water Bottle episode, this was a tremendous win. Shane sped through the rooms at a great pace. He didn't take any shortcuts to the artifact, but he was determined to come out of the temple a winner. After two and a half minutes of temple running, he finally grabbed the Turban, and escaped the temple a mere fourteen seconds later. This was simply a superb episode, and an exciting win added to its value. On an unrelated note, there was a great \"Fogg Quote\" referring to the second temple game, in which players climbed up the pole to turn the spitting camel's head: \"If they had this much water in the Sahara, they'd be in good shape.\"", "Der Kommissar", "This was an excellent solo temple run. The frontrunner went from one end of the temple to the other and back, encountered only a single guard, and achieved the solo victory in just 2:44. Side notes: This is one of very few episodes in which a player enters the Lightning Ball Room. Likewise, the half pendant for the second runner is hidden on the Rock Quarry's actuator for the Laser Light Room.");
