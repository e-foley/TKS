However, after looking at the temple diagram, something looks suspicious right away. The frontrunner only needed to pass through four rooms to get to the Mask! There isn't much to say about this run (really), but I do have a few things to mention. What I always listen to when I see this episode is Kirk's expression when the frontrunner opens the door of the Holes of Python leading to the Tomb: \"A door opened!\" and then almost instantly, \"he got the mask!\" I believe that this door was a faulty one. The cameramen obviously were not ready for him to pass into the Tomb, and nor was Kirk. However, the funniest part about this episode is that the frontrunner took fifty-three seconds to get to the artifact. It took him exactly fifty-three to exit with it as well!","Der Kommissar","As soon as the player entered the Cave of Sighs, a Temple Guard took his pendant. But this didn't slow him down. He went straight to the Tomb, got the mask, and got out in a record time of 1:46. This was one of the few episodes in which the path directly to the treasure worked. Probably an error on the part of the production crew. Side Notes: When the boy is exiting the temple, you can clearly see the Temple Guard in the Cave of Sighs.");
