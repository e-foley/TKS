It took her a total of eight more rooms to encounter her second guard, but by then there were just a few seconds remaining. The second player raced in but could only approach the steps of the temple when time ran out. This could have been a successful run if the frontrunner knew how to climb the wall of the Wall Climb properly. It took her more than one minute just to get out of there! This waste of time cost the second player a trip into the temple. A final note: In this episode, Kirk Fogg had about three times the energy he usually has, and had an interesting habit of interviewing the contestants after each Temple Game. It did add some liveliness to the show.", "Der Kommissar", "This was a pretty basic unsuccessful Temple Run. Kristen, the frontrunner, seemed to know what she was doing, but she moved MUCH too slowly in the temple. Also, she lost her pendant early on to a guard in the Gargoyle room. She stuck to the upper route all the way across the temple, and came down at the Pirates' Cove. When she reached the Swamp with just a few seconds left, it looked as if she may be able to pull of a last second grabbing of the Lucky Pig in the next room, but fate had other plans. A Temple Guard emerged from the Swamp and captured her. Because time was almost up anyway, Scott never even got to go into the temple. All in all, a pretty basic episode. This episode marks the ONLY time an artifact is hidden in the Room of Harmonic Convergence.");
