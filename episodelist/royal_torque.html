One day, Boadicea had enough, so she put on her royal torque and gathered the Iceni together. They decided to fight back with the Romans. Everyone cheered and took up arms and marched towards London. By the time they reached the city, they had a huge army that drove the Romans out. Boadicea then became the Queen of all the Britons and the Royal Torque was torn from her neck during the battle. The Royal Torque could be found in The Tomb of the Headless Kings.";

The frontrunner, Lissy, started off quite well, but was removed from temple in the Chamber after completing the objective. Then it was Nate's turn. He was a fast player, and had a good map of the temple in his head. He followed the top path, took the Shrine/Forest passage, and quickly made his way to the Tomb. He grabbed the Torque with only fourteen seconds to go. Because he felt it would be quicker, he climbed up to the Chamber, but time ran out while he was midway through the Pit of the Pendulum.");
