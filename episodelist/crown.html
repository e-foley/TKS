The Red Jaguars failed to get the half pendant hidden inside the Swamp, and it cost them dearly. They were removed entirely from the temple by a temple spirit residing in the Dark Forest, with more than one minute to go. If they had not encountered a third temple guard, the team would have had a great chance of a victory. Oh well.","Der Kommissar","The second runner in this temple run made two mistakes that cost the team a victory. First and foremost, she passed up a half pendant at the Swamp's entrance to the Dark Forest. And secondly, she tried to get the key from the tree in the Dark Forest, and accordingly, lost. She didn't realize that plowing through the wall and taking the elevator up would have been a quicker route to victory than assembling the Silver Monkey, and this cost her dearly. As a final note, players got captured by Temple Spirits residing in the Dark Forest, but this is the only episode in which a Temple Spirit puts an end to a Temple Run.");
