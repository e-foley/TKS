So William and his men sailed across the English Channel to France to reclaim his throne. So the night before the big battle, William's men saw an enormous comet appear in the sky. Terrified, the men thought it was an evil omen, but William said it was a good one. William felt confident that he was going to defeat Harold. Then, the next day William defeated Harold of Orange and William reclaimed the throne. In honor of his victory, William had the comet embroidered onto his battle flag. The Comet-Embroidered Battle Flag could be found in the Chamber of the Sacred Markers.";

The second player was VERY fast through the rooms, and you could tell that he wanted to get to the Battle Flag, if not bring it out. He took a while in the Dark Forest trying to find the key, and was forced to enter the Quicksand Bog and use the ladder to the Shrine. He assembled the monkey, and in the next room found the correct armor, and then grabbed the Battle Flag with a sigh of relief with just a few seconds to go. If it wasn't for the first player's delay in the Pit, this could have been a close finish.","Der Kommissar","When an artifact is hidden at the center of the temple, you know the team is going to have trouble retrieving it. The frontrunner in this run wasted time climbing out of the Pit of the Pendulum despite the fact that the bottom door was the only one that opened, and this time wasting move cost the team their chance of victory. She was removed from the temple in the Tomb of the Headless Kings, not too long into the run. The second runner blazed through the temple and didn't encounter another guard until the Ancient Warriors room. He got the artifact, but time ran out just as he was entering the Pit by way of the Chamber. Still, when the artifact is hidden at the center of the temple, just making it to it is an accomplishment in its own right. As a final note, this is one of very few season three episodes to feature the alternative pre-temple run footage.","Temple Boy","Olivia made the mistake of climbing the wall when the only open door led to the Tomb of the Headless Kings, but Jonathan made a similarly bad mistake. When he got caught in the Room of the Ancient Warriors (in the very first suit of armor he tried), he should have looked at the doors and seen that he could enter the Chamber and grab the flag. Instead, he tried the other two suits of armor (which killed his last 25 seconds) and prevented the Green Monkeys from a victory. You can say that Olivia's mistake was bad (it was), but Jonathan could have won despite her mistake. Instead, he made an even worse mistake and cost them the grand prize.");
