In the Pit of the Pendulum, he made a smart move and took the bottom path, but he was caught again in the Tomb of the Headless Kings. I was afraid that the skills of such a quick-moving player would be unmatched in his partner, but I was wrong. Kristin was very fast through the rooms, and additionally was a very smart player. She used the key to ascend into the Shrine from the Forest, but then found difficulty assembling the monkey. When she did finally build it, she sprinted into the Room of the Ancient Warriors, grabbed the Egg, and continued out through the top route of the temple. This was a great episode to watch, as it featured close competitions all the way through. A note: Right after the conclusion of the Temple Games, the camera man pretends to \"chase\" Kirk, who eventually jumps into the Pit of the Pendulum. There was some very creative camerawork throughout this episode--good stuff. Finally, listen to Kirk's final words after the temple run, and tell me he isn't a bit repetitive.", "Der Kommissar", "This was an excellent temple run featuring two fast-moving and smart players that knew what they were doing. The frontrunner was removed from the temple just half a minute into the run, and his partner quickly made up for the lost time. She made the smart move of taking the Forest/Shrine passage, got the Egg, and escaped from the temple along the top route in 2:36. Temple runs don't get a whole lot more exciting than this one. As a final note, I think that this episode had the two best \"fade to commercial\" sequences of any episode in the series. The first one was a first-person perspective run up the Temple Entrance stairs into the Crypt, and the second involved a camera person chasing Kirk, who then jumped into the Pit. These cool sequences add to the excellent temple run.");
