The frontrunner moved fairly swiftly through the rooms after she finally got five rocks in the bucket in the Rock Quarry. She was taken out by a temple guard in the Swamp, so with plenty of time to get the artifact out of the temple, her partner raced in. He made a not-so-smart move at the beginning and went up to the Crypt, only to be forced to go back down to the Ledges. He sluggishly moved through the rooms until he made it to where his partner had left off. He found the second half to his pendant on the actuator leading to the Dark Forest, but he had to promptply give it away again after he was captured by a temple spirit. He then spent a ridiculously long period of time in the Dark Forest, and before he finally figured out he could bust through the wall, time was up. As if that wasn't already enough, in the Mine Shaft he tried using the key he kept from the Dark Forest and putting it into the temple guard's peephole.", "Der Kommissar", "In most temple runs that feature a smart and a stupid player, the boy is the smart player and the girl is the stupid one. Here the opposite was true. Once the frontrunner girl was removed from the temple in the Swamp, the boy entered. He slowly progressed to his partner's location of removal, and spent too much time stalling in the Dark Forest. He didn't find out how to exit the room to the Mine Shaft until time was up.");
