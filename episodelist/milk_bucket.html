One day at one of Leif's newest settlements in Newfoundland, Freydis and her husband Ulf were having a discussion about one of their cows that Freydis had roped to restrain it for milking when a band of Skraelings (a type of Eskimo) attacked their town. Ulf wanted to run, but Freydis countered the Skraeling attack by whacking 2 of them in the head with her milk bucket and fighting off 2 more, startling the Skraelings and driving them away. Freydis' milk bucket was lost during the skirmish. The Milk Bucket could be found in the Observatory.";

After grabbing the artifact and running down to the Pit, the frontrunner ran to the edge of the chasm between the two rock ledges, and jumped, only to fall flat against the facing of the second ledge! It was quite a fall; I'll tell you that. Not only did she tumble to the ground, but she also broke the Milk Bucket itself on the fall! Anyway, she made her way through the Ledges and ran out the gates for the solo one-second win.", "Der Kommissar", "Tarrah was somewhat of a slow player who took a wrong turn at least once, but she succeeded nonetheless. After reaching the Observatory, her attempt to jump from rock slab to rock slab failed, meaning she had to crawl through the Ledges. But still, she escaped the temple with a second to spare.");
