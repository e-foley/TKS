Unfortunately, as the second player entered the Dark Forest with more than a minute to go, she completely stalled. She could not figure out where to place the key that she found, and tried sticking it to a bunch of odd places. Once she finally discovered what to do, time was running very short. She grabbed the Bonnet in the Court, but that's all she could do before time ran out. It's a pity that a team this smart failed to win. You could tell that they really wanted their trip to the Bahamas. On a final note--this my not interest anybody--but the scenes taped during the credits prove that the corner door from the Storeroom to the Jester's Court was indeed an active door. It was locked until the Bonnet was picked up, but it shows that other temple-runners did have an option as to which door to take between those rooms.", "Der Kommissar", "This run featured two players who were both extremely fast and intelligent, but they had terrible luck. The frontrunner met a Temple Guard in the Ledges and was forced to traverse upward to the Crypt, wasting a good deal of time. He was removed from the temple in the King's Storeroom. The second runner more than managed to make up for the lost time (she even went straight to the Crypt rather than detouring through the Ledges), but as soon as she entered the Dark Forest, disaster struck. She found the key and desperately searched for the entrance to the Jester's Court's Key Panel. She finally managed to find it, but by now, mere seconds remained on the clock. She got the Bonnet, but didn't get out of the room before time expired. Had the frontrunner started the run by going to the Crypt instead of the Ledges, there is no doubt in my mind that this Temple Run could have been a victory.");
