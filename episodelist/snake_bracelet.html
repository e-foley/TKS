Antony was in much love with Cleopatra, he told her he would buy her a thousand new ones. They sailed off, leaving poor Esmeralda behind.

He made it all the way to the Treasury of Golden Orbs (his fifth room) in thirty-five seconds, where he was taken out. His partner was not quite as fast, but she still fared quite well through the rooms. When she entered the Observatory, she decided to force open the bar blocking the passage to the Treasury, but she soon realized that the Treasury's side door ramained locked. She retreated back, climbed down the ladder to the Room of Fallen Columns, and then made her way across the rooms until she grabbed the bracelet with 1:01 to go. She took a rather strange route out of the temple, but it was still fast enough to win with a third of a minute to go. As a quick note, the door from the Treasury to the Observatory remained locked when Tracy grabbed the artifact. It should have opened on its own.","Aaron F.","This episode had one very smart player and one lucky, slow player. Even though they won, they could have set a record. But as I said, the second player made one dumb move that made her run into a dead end in the Celestial Lights room, but the team did deserve the trip to Saddleback Ranch. Notes: I got to tell you, if you cross your arms during the Steps of Knowledge you don&#146;t want to go to the Temple Games or you are bored (Green Monkeys). Rare Moat Crossing event. Trip to Saddleback Ranch.");
