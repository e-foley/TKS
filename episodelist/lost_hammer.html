One day, the railroad's foreman held a contest with a man named Mr. Jones to see who could drill through rock faster, Henry or Mr. Jones' steam engine powered drill. In the end, Henry beat the drill by making it 15 feet through the rock in the time allotted, whereas the drill only made it 9 feet. The other workers celebrated by raising Henry up on their shoulders, and the railroad retired the hammer Henry used that day.

Kim obviously had never heard of an actuator, so when she was in the Wall Climb, she knocked on doors helplessly until Kirk shouted \"push the buttons\" loud enough for her to hear. She chose to go into the Heart Room, where she was caught by a very late temple guard, and in Throne Room below, was taken out (thankfully). Billy had his route all planned out in anticipation, and actually made it quite far in the 1:19 he had. But even then, he had no prayer of making it to the artifact in time.","Der Kommissar","Here's one of those episodes where a tactical genius is forced to join forces with one of the most slow-witted contestants in the show's history. It took the frontrunner over a minute to realize you needed to hit actuators to open the doors in the Wall Climb! Thankfully, she was taken out of the temple, but it wasn't soon enough. Accordingly, the second runner didn't have time enough to make up for his partner's incompetence - time expired just as he entered the Torch Room from below. Too bad he didn't get paired up with a smarter player - chances are he could have set a record if he had a more intelligent partner!","Bob Maibaum", "There were 2 things that doomed this run to failure. First, Kim being oblivious that you had to hit the buttons to open the doors in the Wall Climb. Second was Billy's failed attempts to climb up the web in the Spider's Lair to try to get to the Room of the Golden Idols. These 2 mistakes cost the team a whole minute! With this time they would've easily been able to get to the artifact, and get it out.");
