Kim obviously had never heard of an actuator, so when she was in the Wall Climb, she knocked on doors helplessly until Kirk shouted \"push the buttons\" loud enough for her to hear. She chose to go into the Heart Room, where she was caught by a very late temple guard, and in Throne Room below, was taken out (thankfully). Billy had his route all planned out in anticipation, and actually made it quite far in the minute he had. But even then, he had no prayer of making it to the artifact in time.","Der Kommissar","Here's one of those episodes where a tactical genius is forced to join forces with one of the most slow-witted contestants in the show's history. It took the frontrunner over a minute to realize you needed to hit actuators to open the doors in the Wall Climb! Thankfully, she was taken out of the temple, but it wasn't soon enough. Accordingly, the second runner didn't have time enough to make up for his partner's incompetence - time expired just as he entered the Torch Room from below. Too bad he didn't get paired up with a smarter player - chances are he could have set a record if he had a more intelligent partner!");
