Unfortunately, Tara did not take an efficient way out of the temple. From the Treasure Room, she went up to the Observatory, and then down all the way to the Throne Room. When she was in the Wheel Room, time ran out.","Der Kommissar","Both players in this Temple Run moved pretty fast through the temple. They had to pass through nine rooms to get the artifact, so just getting to it was an accomplishment in its own right. Unfortunately, the second runner took the WORST possible route out of the temple, so time expired.","Doug E. Fresh","This run featured a rather unusual layout. Once Tara completed the Shrine of the Silver Monkey objective, the door leading to the Room of the Three Torches didn’t open, so she was forced to take a different path. She chose the Well and grabbed the medal with about twenty seconds left. When she entered the Observatory, she chose to go down the central shaft instead going across the bridge. This resulted in a loss. If Tara had chosen to go across the bridge, this would’ve been a very close finish. I say the difficult layout cost this team more than Tara’s exit plan though.");
