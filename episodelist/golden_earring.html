In the Dark Forest, she found the key, but did not use it to ascend into the Shrine. Instead, she bashed through the wall into the Mine Shaft only to encounter her second temple guard. Usually, removal of the frontrunner from the temple is a bad thing, but Shem made me feel differently when he ran into the temple. He was one of the speediest players of all time, determined, and not afraid of running out of energy. He blazed through the rooms up to the point of his partner's departure, and then proceeded to complete the monkey with ease. After completing the objective in the King's Storeroom, he proceeded to head up into the Observatory, with less than ten seconds remaining. He quickly assembled the statue, climbed down the ladder, and grabbed the ring just before time expired. What was interesting about this run is that in the Crypt, it was the <span style='font-style: italic'>third</span> book that opened the door. In the Pit, it was the <span style='font-style: italic'>third</span> door that opened. In the Jester's court, it was the <span style='font-style: italic'>third</span> wall painting to open the door. In the King's storeroom, it was both the <span style='font-style: italic'>third</span> pot and the <span style='font-style: italic'>third</span> pedestal that opened the doors. Tough luck but good players!", "Der Kommissar", "This was one of the most exciting temple runs of all time, even if it was a loss. Both players moved fast through the Temple, and in many cases, tried doors leading toward the artifact. When Ashley was taken out in the Mine Shaft, Shem made a mad dash to where his partner was taken out. He made up for lost time, but after completing the objective in the Storeroom, he failed to try the door that connected to that room (I couldn't tell if it opened, as the camera work was sloppy) and traversed into the Observatory. With mere seconds remaining, he assembled the picture on the stone column, went down the shaft, and got the Earring. Time expired before he could do anything else. Side Notes: Only time a Temple Guard was ever in the Mine Shaft, and only time an artifact was ever hidden in the Room of the Mandarin Hand.","Doug E. Fresh","The team in this run was very good, but they had like the worst luck in the world in this run. As Ed said, three’s a charm. Not only that, but the door connecting the King’s Storeroom and the Room of the Mandarin Hand didn’t open (I don’t think it did, but it’s hard to tell because of the poor camera angle), so Shem was forced to go upstairs to the Observatory, where he quickly completed the objective and grabbed the earring before time was up. This was a very exciting loss because of the drama at the end.");
