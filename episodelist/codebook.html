The first player looked promising, but when he was taken out in the Treasure Room, there was no chance of the second player making any progress. This run was very similar to \"The Water Bottle of Ponce de Leon\" (1-5), in a few ways. First of all, both artifacts were hidden in the Heart Room, and secondly, both frontrunners attempting to get the artifact were taken out one room away from it. A tough design hurt both teams and decimated their chances of winning. Note that while in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, the second player picks up the half pendant from the statue base, but immediately sets it aside.", "Der Kommissar", "Here's another one of those teams you can't help but feel sorry for. The frontrunner moved through the temple at good speed, but got taken out in the Treasure Room - just one room away from the artifact. His partner had no prayer of making up the lost time. Time expired just as she was entering the holes of Python.");
