When Kamehameha died, he was buried in a secret ritual. However, one of the servants who buried him stole the Palaoa and sailed to the Fiji Islands in hopes of using the pendant's power to become a chief or king. The Pendant could be found in the Spider's Lair.";

He was removed from the temple in his fourth room, in less than half a minute. Then followed his partner Tina. She was not as fast as her partner, but had a good map of the temple in her head. She took the long route around the temple, through the Pirates' Cove and the Dungeon, and at last she made it to the Tomb. But then, something completely unexpected (and ridiculous) happened: A lazy temple guard from the DUNGEON slowly trotted into the Tomb to end the run. Temple runs do not get any more unfair than this.","Der Kommissar","On your mark, get set, GO! Robbie raced into the temple, carrying the only pendant that he and his partner had won in the Temple Games. He blazed through the temple at a speed I have never seen any other contestant move at. Sadly though, he was removed from the temple in the Heart Room, just 26 seconds into the run. And then Tina came in. She wasn't nearly as fast as Robbie and stalled a bit going through the rooms, but was still a decent player. For reasons unknown she entered the Temple via the Gargoyle room and NOT the cave - a move that would have proven tragic if a guard had been there. Still, she continued to cruise through the temple along the top floor. Once she entered the Pirates Cove, she spun the wheel and descended into the Dungeon. She then plowed through the wall and entered the Tomb Of Ancient Kings, with the artifact just one room away, but got a nasty surprise - A Temple Guard emerged from the Dungeon, putting an end to this run with roughly 53 seconds left on the clock. To put it simply, this team didn't make very many mistakes - it was their lack of a second pendant that cost them. Side notes: The team entered every room of the temple other than the Spider's Lair. Likewise, this is the only episode to ever feature a Temple Guard in the Dungeon.","Bob Maibaum","Isn't it ironic that in this temple run, the artifact was THE EXACT THING that the Silver Snakes lacked.");
