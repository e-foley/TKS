The frontrunner was taken out of the temple inside the Throne Room in no time at all, but the second contestant followed up on his progress pretty well. She found a half pendant at the left wall of the Swamp, and needed it, as there was a temple spirit residing in the following room. She made a smart decision and took the shortcut from the Dark Forest to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, where she took an unexpected left turn. It did not really matter however, as she could not have done anything with the wasted time. It should also be mentioned that the Moat crossing was absolutely grueling--quite possibly the longest the show ever had. In fact, it ran out of its classic fog about a third of the way into the round.", "Der Kommissar", "This episode is a pretty typical Season Two Legends loss. The team took the bottom floor, which was a smart move - I'm sure they'd watched the show before. They gave it a great effort, but sadly, came up short. Artifacts at the central shaft of the Temple are difficult to reach, and you can see why in this episode.","Bob Maibaum","After the 3rd Temple Game, the camera paned up to where the crown should have been, but it's not there!");
