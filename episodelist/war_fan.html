(The ruler of Feudal Japan) However, the evil Lord Kira was able to successfully attack and kill Asano. Upon hearing of the death of their Lord, the 47 Ronin began to plot their revenge. Learning of the plot, Kira decided to fortify his defenses. But the 47 Ronin were patient, and waited until Kira had dropped his guard to attack. The Ronin fought through the recently reduced number of guards, found Kira in a bathroom, killed him, then surrendered to the Shogun. Instead of punishing the Ronin, the Shogun ordered that their story be painted onto a war fan. The War Fan could be found in the Quicksand Bog.";

The frontrunner started off with the team's only pendant, but was quickly caught by a temple guard in the Crypt. He managed to continue right along the top floor of the temple, with a slight detour going down to the Tomb of the Headless Kings. He was removed from the temple in the Room of the Secret Password, just a room away from the War Fan. With 1:06 left, the second player raced into the temple and followed her partner's exact route. Just as she was about to enter the Tomb of the Headless Kings, disaster. Her partner, in all of the haste to find the skull and put it on the right neck, accidentally knocked the door shut, blocking her access! She wandered around for about thirty seconds wondering what to do, and finally, the door was triggered open. (I'm not sure how it opened as the camerawork was very sloppy.) Although she got through, the team missed their chances of getting to the artifact. As a final note, this is one of the few episodes in Season 3 where the alternate pre-temple-run footage was shown.","Der Kommissar","Temple runs don't get any more unfair than this one. Most temple runs are unfair because of the doors that open or the placement of the temple guards, but this one was unfair because of a production defect. The frontrunner made great progress toward the artifact and was taken from the temple in the Secret Password room, just above the artifact. The second runner couldn't progress from the Pit to the Tomb because the frontrunner had accidentally slammed the door shut while completing the objective (the door should NOT have stuck shut.) It took the production crew a good thirty seconds or so to open the door, and by the time it was open, victory or even reaching the artifact was impossible. Had this little defect not occured, the team probably could have reached the Fan.","Ian Fisne","The second player could have chosen to take the open Pit/Chamber door to save time if she had wanted.");
