If the team did not make a few unnecessary turns, this could have easily been a successful run. After Kevin parts from his original path and goes up to Medusa's Lair, a temple guard removes him from the temple. Kelly then follows the bottom path all the way to the Mine Shaft, where she smartly takes the ladder to the Shrine. What she does in the Shrine is far from "smart" however. She picks up the base and then the middle section of the monkey. She clumsily brings them to the front of the room, and upon setting them down, fumbles the middle section clear over the railing of the temple! After it falls to the studio floor, a "temple spirit" picks it up and tosses it back over the railing and to the Shrine. (I suppose the "temple spirit" was either a stray temple guard or a cameraman, but I will never know.) She didn't have enough time left to complete the statue. As you can see, this was not the best temple run ever, but it sure was memorable!

<font size=2>
<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
This was a memorable episode, not because it was a victory, but because of a totally unexpected event. The second runner made it to the Shrine, just one room away from the artifact. She foolishly took all three pieces of the Monkey to the pedestal at the front of the room - and the middle part fell right over the edge! It was return-tossed to her by a Temple Spirit (we never find out who or what this person really was.) Sadly, due to her folly in the Shrine, she wasn't able to get the artifact in time. Contrary to popular belief, though, this is NOT the only episode in which a player drops a piece of the Monkey off the railing. The other is the Upside Down Compass of Henry Hudson (3-1.)<p align=left>

<i>Aaron F.</i>:
As Kevin raced into the temple he was instantly greeted by a temple guard which really scared him. From that point on he was hesitant. If he had used better judgment he would have gone up to the center room (I doubt the door to the King's Storeroom via Medusa's Lair would have opened anyway). He gets caught by a temple guard in the Dark Forest. So, the second runner Kelly comes in a little slow but at a good pace--then she made 2 critical errors that cost the team the victory or at least reaching the artifact.  First she drops the middle part of the monkey so a Temple spirit helps her out, but not only that--she couldn’t figure out how to put it together. For the last 30 seconds she plays with the middle piece and when time runs out she pretty much gave up. You would think that the player would watch a previous episode before coming on the show to see how the game is played. When you look at the three errors you could say the error cost the team the victory. Side Notes: Trip to Sanibal Harbor Resort and Spa.
