The first player on the Silver Snakes passed through the temple with great speed. He followed the top route without a problem until he was forced down into  the temple-guarded Medusa's Lair and then into the Laser Light Room where he was taken out. The second player followed the path of her partner taking the bridge route and then descending the central shaft. She completed the Laser Light Room's objective and passed into the Swamp... Where a temple guard was waiting. Now, although she only had a half pendant, she gave it to the guard and kept going through the Swamp for about six more seconds before Kirk finally realized that she had been "taken out of the temple." The clock kept going for all that time, too! The ending was a great laugh. NOTE: This is one of the episodes where Olmec lets teams answer three times in the Steps.

<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
This [run] featured two smart players who seemed to know what they were doing. Michael entered the temple via the top route and descended down the center shaft, only to be removed from the temple in the Laser Light Room. Emily came next, but made the fatal error that cost them victory - she passed up the other half of her pendant in Medusa's Lair. In the Swamp, a guard put an end to the temple run. On a more comical note, Emily gave him the half pendant and kept going - Kirk didn't even realize the run was over until she had hit the Dark Forest's actuator! Side note: This episode marks the only episode in which a half pendant is hidden in Medusa's Lair (although we never do see where in the room it's hidden.)<p align=left>

<i>PAK Man</i>:
Although the Temple Run was ended early by a third Temple Guard, that didn't stop this episode from being memorable. This was one of only two episodes (the other being The Paintbrush of Leonardo Da Vinci) where there was a four-way tie on the second-to-last step. Also, one of the most famous Steps of Knowledge goof-ups of all time occurs here. Olmec says, "Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel on wet plaster..." to which one player buzzes in with the response, "Um, a scaffolding?" Olmec tells her it's incorrect, then finishes the question by saying "is this type of painting called a stucco, fresco or roccoco?" Finally, Kirk is standing on some sort of elevated platform for the third temple game, which is the one where the players climb the stairs. This is something he never did in any other episode. This is definitely one of the more quirky episodes of all time, even though it was a loss.
