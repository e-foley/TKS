In 323 BC, he led an army of half a million men and conquered enough territory to have been one of the largest empires in history. However, that was almost not the case. One night when he was a young cattle herder, he felt a nudge against his body. He thought that it may have been his friend or one of the cows, but it turned out to be a enormous lion. Chandragupta was terrified, but the lion suddenly bowed his head to Chandragupta, then left. His friend told him that it was a sign that he would one day be king. Once that prophesy came true, Chandragupta adopted the figure of a lion for his royal golden bracelet. The Lion-Headed Bracelet could be found in the Quicksand Bog.";

It's a good thing she knew what she was doing, as she had to pass through seven rooms herself on the way to the artifact. In the King's Storeroom, she found the half pendant, and then signaled it to her partner in case he would need to go in--another smart move. She made it all the way to the Bracelet with forty-four seconds remaining, and finished off the solo victory with six seconds to spare. She and her partner both won a trip to San Diego for their efforts through the show.<p>I have a ton of extra notes about this episode. First of all, up until the temple run, Olmec was lit with an unusual but interesting light pattern that was different from the other Season 3 episodes. Secondly, Kirk led off one of the temple games by saying, \"On your mark, get set, LAUNCH!\" The Silver Snake player was still waiting for the \"Go!\" signal after he had said that, so it delayed the team a few seconds while Kirk told him, \"That means go, go!\" There was also a unique temple footage preceding the run that showed the Bracelet in the Bog during the explanation of that room. There was no audience at all during the taping of this run, or at least, no evidence of an audience. While explaining the temple to the Green Monkeys, Olmec's mouth audibly squeaks. Listen closely for it! Finally, Kirk Fogg does NOT end this episode with his classic \"Join us next time for another great Legend of the Hidden Temple!\" like he does in ALL others.","Der Kommissar","It took Andrea some time to get to the Quicksand Bog by way of the top floor of the Temple, and being slowed down by a Temple Guard in the Room of the Ancient Warriors didn't help things any. But still, she managed to get the bracelet and escape the temple with six seconds to spare.","Michael Hackney","What made this Temple run more incredible was the fact that Andrea went through all those rooms, got the bracelet, and still got out in time going through the cluttered bottom portion of the Temple. Says a lot about the determination of the human spirit, doesn't it?");
