The chief welcomed Mary, and the next day the chief gave her a gift, the dried hands and feet of someone who previously visited Efoua. After they got back on the trail, Mary threw away the shriveled parts, and a chimpanzee retrieved them. The Shriveled Hand could be found in The Swamp.";

She was taken out of the temple on a second consecutive guard in Medusa's Lair (who was wearing a headcam, FYI). Her partner moved at about the same speed she did, and managed to clear rooms until the Mine Shaft. He ran out of time climbing the ladder to the Shrine, strangely enough. Although it does not seem like it from watching the episode, this was one of the most difficult temple designs the show ever had. It required a minimum of eight rooms to pass through before reaching the room of the artifact (the Shrine-Forest door was locked), which is a lot to ask of two young kids. The temple games were the staple of this episode, while the run was somewhat lacking.");
