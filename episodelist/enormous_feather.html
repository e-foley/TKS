The second player was the opposite in nearly every way. She was much slower than her teammate, and had no idea what to do in each room. She even looked hopeless in the rooms that had already been cleared out for her! Eventually, she managed to make it along the top floor and to the artifact. With a mere ten seconds remaining, she grabbed it, but couldn't take it across the Pit of the Pendulum before she ran out of time. With only a little more effort, the players could have had an easy win.","Der Kommissar","This was a disappointing episode. The frontrunner was quite fast and knew what he was doing, but was removed just a minute into the run by a Temple Spirit residing in the Dark Forest. The second runner was extremely slow-witted and was far too hesitant - sometimes she stood completely still for seconds at a time with a dumb look on her face. She got the feather, but time ran out as she was crossing the Pit of the Pendulum. Had she not stalled so much, this team could have achieved a victory. Still, I'm impressed that they reached the artifact with only a single pendant.");
