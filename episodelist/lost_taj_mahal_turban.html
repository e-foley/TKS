The only thing he really cared about was the Taj Mahal, which his father had built for his mother, so much that he had an image of the building embroidered on his favorite turban which he wore daily. However, one morning Aurangzeb's guards found him ransacking his bedchambers. Upon asking why he was doing so, Aurangzeb reported that his turban was missing, and was looking for it. Just then, the Grand Vizier entered and said that it was just a turban, and that he could have another one made. But Aurangzeb objected, stating that he wanted his turban. At this a young woman came into the room, was confronted by the Vizier, and identified herself as Irine, Aurangzeb's Chief Accountant. She then accused the Vizier of stealing the turban to sell to a rich collector, and implicated that he had stolen more of the Emperor's belongings to sell. The Vizier replied by attacking Irine's creditability, to which Aurangzeb called him a liar, and ordered that he be arrested. With this Irine was named the new Grand Vizier, and the tuban was returned to Aurangzeb. The Taj Mahal Turban could be found in the Room of the Secret Password.";
