This was a pretty frustrating temple run. The frontrunner was very speedy but was removed from the temple in the Treasure Room, having progressed five rooms in just thirty-seven seconds. The second player was not the same. He trudged through the rooms at a sluggish pace, and instead of immediately riding the elevator down from the Room of Three Torches, he spent a while trying to put the torch in the right holder. The good news: He grabbed the Lariat with all of fifty-two seconds left to go in the run. The bad news: He had the worst planning skills I've ever seen getting out of the temple. Additionally, he barely made an effort to speed up. I'd rather not list everything that could have been inproved upon, but I will say that he was just entering the Cave of Size when time ran out. Note: Although the team did not win, they entered every single room of the temple.<p align=left><font color="darkblue"><b>Summary below by Michael Hackney</b></font><p align=left>
While the second runner may have been slow in the temple, Kirk may be somewhat to blame for this team's failure. When the second runner grabbed the Lariat, he began climbing the ladder from the Well to the Shrine. Good move...until Kirk told him to bust through the wall, a call the second runner heeded. The rest is history.<p align=left>

Summary below by Ian Fisne:</b></font><p align=left>
Throughout the episode summaries I've seen, everyone seems to be missing one 
crucial factor in this temple run: the second runner, Chris, WAS too slow, 
but the first runner, Colleen, is as much, if not more, to blame for this 
loss. The reason? She was very quick through the temple, but she didn't pay 
attention in the Observatory. She spun the celestial lights (room objective) 
and immediately headed for the ladder down to the Heart Room, but it's 
clearly seen to her and the home audience that the bar/door on the left 
opened to the Treasure Room a second later. She still heads down to the 
Heart Room, encounters a Temple Guard, opens the door to the Treasure Room, 
and heads left to that room, where she encounters a second guard. Chris then 
runs in and, when he gets to the Observatory, heads straight across into the 
Treasure Room (the open path Colleen didn't take). Chris never encountered a 
temple guard (good thing, considering he only had a half-pendant), and 
Colleen could have had a solo victory and probably beat the Mask of Shaka 
Zulu record time the way she was moving if she hadn't missed the open door. 
(Colleen's strategy was just to head across the top floor and come down at 
the Room of Three Torches; this is apparent because, in the Heart Room, she 
didn't even try the door leading down to the Throne Room.)
