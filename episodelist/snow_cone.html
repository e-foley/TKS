Kilimanjaro is so tall that it has snow atop the mountain all year-round. In 1866, New told his cook and native guide Tofiki that they were going higher up the mountain than anybody had before. Despite his reservations, Tofiki loyally led the way. After days of difficult climbing, and with only fruit left to eat, the two decided to make camp. However, New suddenly saw something reflecting the moonlight, discovered it was snow, and called to Tofiki. Thinking New was in danger, Tofiki grabbed his spear and rushed to New's side. New told Tofiki of his discovery, to which Tofiki became annoyed and returned to camp. New collected some ice, and Tofiki squeezed the last of their oranges on top of it, creating the first snow cone. The Snow Cone could be found in the Room of the Ancient Warriors.";

The frontrunner was taken out by a temple spirit in the Dark Forest, so with less than a minute to go, the second contestant tried to make some progress towards the Snow Cone. The player found the key in the tree and opened the door to go upwards. This looked good! The player would be entering the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, right? Actually, the cabinet-like door inside the Shrine of the Silver Monkey leading to the Dark Forest did NOT open, so the player climbed a ladder in darkness and did not know where to proceed to. Tough luck. Note: You can clearly see two cameramen when they show the shot of the second player climbing to the Shrine, as well as a hidden temple guard under a pile of bricks in the Quicksand Bog, who would have ended this run anyway.","Der Kommissar","This is a pretty mediocre temple run. Casey, he frontrunner, after entering the Temple through the Crypt, encountered a guard in the Tomb of Headless Kings (which doesn't surprise me at all.) He wasted quite a bit of time in this room completing the objective. In the Jesters Court, he had equally bad luck and it took him a good deal of time to complete the objective. In the Dark Forest, a Temple Sprit ended his run. Heather followed his footsteps to the Dark Forest, found the key and used it to ascend the ladder to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, but for some unknown reason, the door directly into the Shrine wasn't opening (my guess is that it was stuck shut.) Because of this and Casey's time wasting, the group ran out of time.","Aaron F.","As the frontrunner made his way through the Tomb of the Headless Kings, he got the skull and tried to put it on from the front--clever, but I guess it didn't work. Then he got to the Jester's Court where he wasted valuable time which could have made the run a little more interesting, if the second player or the crew knew what they were doing. The second player went up the ladder to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey and I guess the crew didn’t open the door. Time expired quickly after. Side Notes: Trip to Fort Myers beach.");
