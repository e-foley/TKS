Since the town he presided over didn't have a courthouse or jail, proceedings were held in Bean's old saloon, and convicts usually had to pay fines to Bean himself. Bean had a pet bear, who he used to keep people in line. In an example of his shrewdness, one day a couple of men brought an unconscious man before Bean. They stated that they'd found him at the base of the new bridge, thought he had fallen off of it, and had nothing to identify him and $40 on his person. Even though the man was unconscious, Bean still found him guilty of loitering, and fined him the $40 found before ordering him to be taken for medical treatment. With this he slammed his thornwood gavel, ending the case. The Thornwood Gavel could be found in the Jester's Court.";

In the final game, the teams had to travel to places where money was hidden in large wheels, retrieve the money, and go deposit it into their vaults.";

In the run, the frontrunner, Michael, made superb time when he was removed in the Room of the Secret Password. His partner, Kelly, was unfrotunately a poor planner. Instead of the logical decision to follow her partner's route, she went up into the King's Storeroom where she had to complete the objective to pass into the Room of the Ancient Warriors. After delaying a lot through the already completed rooms, she took an even longer time in the Room of the Secret Password, where she laid out all the passwords at the front of the room as she said them. She made it into the Quicksand Bog, but considering she had a full eighty seconds to herself and a cleared-out path, she should have been the one to bring the Gavel out of the temple, even if it meant going through nearly every room of the temple on her way.","Der Kommissar","One wrong turn spelled disaster for the team in this run. The frontrunner assembled the statue in the Shrine, and although the Bog door opened, he instead progressed to the Secret Password room, where he was removed from the temple. His partner was slow-witted, and went to the King's Storeroom where she met a Temple Guard and was forced to complete the objective. She also tried completing the objective in the Room of the Ancient Warriors - even though her partner had already done so. She also neglected to take the Shrine-Bog path. Time ran out just as she had entered the Quicksand Bog via the Pharaoh's Secret Passage. Had the frontrunner gone straight down to the Bog, chances are this would have been a victory. Side note: An extremely rare example of an episode in which the Tomb of Headless Kings does not have a Temple Guard, nor does it have the artifact.","Michael Hackney","Kelli was a poor planner, making a few mistakes oh her way through the temple. Kelli made a big error in not taking the path already cleared. Another big error she made was not removing her mouthpiece in the Room of the Secret Password. She sounded like she'd gotten too much novocaine at the dentist trying to read those passwords.");
