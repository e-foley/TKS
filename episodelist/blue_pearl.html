After descending in the elevator, he smashed through the wall, only to be taken out by the guard stationed there. Jennifer, in her attempt to make up for lost time, moved speedily though the rooms, out and around all the way to her partner's removal. She found the key in the Tomb, and entered the Python Holes with a mere ten seconds remaining. Kirk commented, \"I think she's gonna make it,\" but he spoke too soon. With three seconds left, she dove for the pearl, but her fingertips could not quite make contact with the artifact. This episode, unsurprisingly, is the closest a player has gotten to the artifact without reaching it.", "Der Kommissar", "Albert, the frontrunner, blazed through the temple - until he got to the Treasure Room. A temple guard stalled him severely, and it took him a few seconds to get his bearings straight. After traversing downward from the Torch Room, he was removed from the temple in the Tomb - just one room away from the artifact. Jennifer retraced his steps and made it into the Python Holes. She desperately climbed through the holes in a hurry, and in the last seconds, dove for the Pearl, reaching desperately for it. She missed it by just inches. Too bad.");
