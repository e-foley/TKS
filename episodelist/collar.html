The collar was returned through the gates with five seconds to go.","Mike Lowrey","This was a fantastic temple run. The frontrunner had a good plan to get to the artifact (which was to go up to the Golden Orbs from the Holes of Python and head into the Shrine) but her plan was sabotaged when the door leading to the Holes of Python wouldn't open. She went up into the Room of Fallen Columns and went up into the Observatory where she was taken out by a temple guard. The second runner followed his partner's trail, a smart move considering he had no pendant. He made his way to the Observatory and made it to the Treasury of Golden Orbs. He completed the objective and went into the Shrine and grabbed the collar and made it out with only 5 seconds to spare.","Mike Hackney","Kirk actually waited for the collar to come into his hands before he started celebrating. In all other episodes, it seems just passing through the gates is enough.");
