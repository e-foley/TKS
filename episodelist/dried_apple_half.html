Walter told Gesslar that William can shoot an apple off of a tree from 100 yards away. So Gesslar wanted proof by having William shoot an apple off of Walter's head. William took two arrows from his quiver and shot the apple into two. The other arrow was for Gesslar. Gesslar took William away, but William escaped and lead the fight for independence. Walter dried the apple half and hid it away until it made it to the temple. The Dried Apple Half could be found in the Room of the Ancient Warriors.";

The average temple run requires its players to pass through six, and at the most seven rooms before entering the room of the artifact. This one required eight as a minimum, but the frontrunner added an additional room to that number. From the Crypt, a door opened to the Ledges, which then opened the bottom door to the Pit. From here, the frontrunner was forced to climb to the King's Storeroom and work his way down to the Tomb, where he was taken out. The second player was one of the slowest in the show's history and just made it out of the Pit before her fifty-seven allotted seconds expired, but it didn't matter, as Brett and Lauren had not a prayer in the first place.","Der Kommissar","Although it appears that the Green Monkeys didn't make very much progress in this temple run, the temple was set up in a downright brutal design. Even after the frontrunner pulled all three books in the Crypt, the only door that opened was the one to the Ledges - where a Temple Guard was waiting. In the Pit of the Pendulum, the only door that opened was the King's Storeroom. From there on, the only doors that opened took him straight down to the Tomb Of Headless Kings, where he was removed from the temple by a second guard. The second runner wasn't able to make any new progress in the temple, and time expired just as she entered the King's Storeroom. I think it's pretty obvious that the production crew expected a little too much out of the players in this episode.","Jake Potts","I wasn't happy with this run because of a long route the Green Monkeys had to take. Brett was a fast little guy, but he had to travel down into the Ledges, where Temple Guard #1 was located. Brett had to take the bottom door to the pit. He trouble getting out of the it. He raced into the King's Storeroom, but he tried putting the key into the door of the Ancient Warriors Room. He was caught in the Tomb of the Headless Kings with 0:59 seconds left. Lauren was absolutely slow through the Ledges, and the pit. Time ran out when she was headded to the King's Storeroom. This was a bad run.");
