Even though her Navy was outnumbered, they handily defeated the attacking Spaniards. To show her appreciation for Drake's work, she presented him with a tiny gold ship.

Had the players moved faster up the Wall Climb, chances are the team could have lost with over two minutes remaining on the clock! The team in this episode was one of many Season One teams that did not find the other half of the pendant in the temple, and it cost them dearly.");
