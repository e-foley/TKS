One day, he and Gasim traveled on camels to a nearby Oasis. A sandstorm came up and they both lost their way. When the storm was over, they were face-to-face with enemy troops. Gasim, terrified, pulled out a table cloth and put it over Lawrence's head. The troops then went away. For the rest of the war, Lawrence wore his headgear and it made its way to the temple.

Well, the crew chose a good one to show, as this was the most exciting one-second win in the first season. The frontrunner wasn't too fast, but seemed to know what she was doing. After she was removed from the Room of Fallen Columns, her partner raced toward where she left off. He progressed through the rooms more quickly than his partner did, and made it all the way to the Holes of Python, where the artifact was hidden. It looked doubtful up to this point that the team would win, but after he grabbed the Headdress with 0:28 seconds left, he went into high gear. He blazed through the Wheel Room and the Cave of Size, and made it through the temple gates with but a second to go.", "Mstrgmr", "While running out of The Temple with the headdress, the boy Green Monkey climbed up the holes still left from The Pit instead of using the ladder. It was pretty cool too, he scaled it really fast.", "Aaron F.", "The frontrunner seemed to know what she was doing but wasn't very fast, especially in the Ledges. She was taken out at the Fallen Columns room, then the second player came in. He was fast, strong, smart, but the main factor was luck. You would think, knowing how unfair the crew was the first season, they would have made him go to the Room of Three Torches, but they let him go down which made all the difference. Notes: This was the first episode that Nickelodeon aired. It was also weird and annoying how Olmec's voice echoed so much.","Doug E. Fresh","At first, I thought this run would be a complete failure because Candice wasted nearly thirty seconds in the Cave of Sighs to start off the run. Once she got out and made it to the Room of the Royal Gongs, she quickly made up for some lost time. Once she completed the Observatory objective, the Treasury of Golden Orbs opened, but instead of choosing this path, she went into the Room of the Fallen Columns where she was taken out. David followed Candice’s exact path instead of taking the easier path. David was fast though, and he got the headdress with twenty-seven seconds remaining. At first, I thought victory wasn’t possible, but David made it out with two seconds remaining for one of my favorite wins the show has ever had.");
