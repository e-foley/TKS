The frontrunner made it nearly all the way to the artifact, but got taken out in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, where the second player took over and raced to where she left off. After assembling the monkey, he went straight down the elevator with less than ten seconds to go. Slowly, slowly, it descended. In the final seconds of the run, he reached for the robe, but came just short when time expired. It was not just this last-second grab that made the temple run interesting, but this episode was one of the few where the wall connecting the Mine Shaft and the Dark Forest was sealed. The only question I have about this sealed door is what would happen if the player grabbed the artifact and started to run out? Could the player bust through the wall on the return trip? Although these questions may never be answered, I will remember this temple run for that peculiar quality.", "Der Kommissar", "The frontrunner was making great time through the temple when she entered the Dark Forest and encountered her first guard. I thought to myself that victory was inevitable, and then, disaster. The wall connecting the Forest and the Mine Shaft would NOT break down! This forced her to go up into the Shrine, where she was removed. The second runner took the Vipers Nest elevator down to the shaft in the last few seconds of the run. Sadly, he wasn't able to reach the Robe before time expired. As a side note, this is one of only two episodes where the rocky wall connecting the Bottom Left Corner room and the Golden Doors room doesn't break down. The other is the Keys to the Alhambra (1-3.)");
