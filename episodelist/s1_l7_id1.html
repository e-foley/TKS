Judging by the diagram, it does not appear that the team made it far, but the temple was set up in a brutal design. The doors to the Tomb of Ancient Kings from the Bamboo Forest did not work, so the frontrunner tried the doors to go up, but none opened. After spending a full minute in that room, she retreated back to the Room of Harmonic Convergence, where she went up to the Heart Room. She wasn't even allowed access to the Treasure Room from there, so she was forced to go up once more into the Observatory. She was then caught by a second temple guard. The second player went as far as he could, but did not nearly have enough time to make any progress. Note: This temple design was an exact copy of "The Paintbrush of Leonardo Da Vinci" found in Season 1, Layout 5.<p align=left><font color="darkgreen"><b>Summary below by Der Kommissar:</b></font><p align=left>

This temple run featured a downright brutal layout. The frontrunner raced straight along the bottom floor of the temple into the Bamboo Forest - and the room contained both a Temple Guard and a dead end. Because of this, it took her over a minute just to get out of that room! After correcting her dead end turn and progressing up to the heart room, she wasn't even allowed access to the Treasure Room via the Heart Room! She was removed from the temple in the Observatory. The second runner wasn't able to make any additional progress before time expired. As a final note, this was the only episode to feature a Temple Guard in the Bamboo Forest.

It's understandable why this team didn't make it to the artifact. The layout design was just terrible. The frontrunner made excellent time as he sped through the bottom floor of the temple. Once she entered the Bamboo Forest (and met a temple guard), she tried the door to the Tomb of Ancient Kings but that was obviously locked. She tried the doors that led up into the Treasure Room but no such luck. She spent well over a minute before she went back into the Room of Harmonic Convergence and went up into the Heart Room. Right here it shows how much the producers expected of these kids. After trying the actuator leading to the Treasure Room, the door remained locked, so she went up into the Observatory, where she was taken out. The second runner didn't have time to make additional progress. He did all he could before time expired.
