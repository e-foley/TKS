Because there were no ladders going downwards, and because the artifact was just a room to the left, the Room of the Ancient Warriors was a complete dead end. The frontrunner was not the fastest in the world, and this dead end did not help the team out any more. The frontrunner retreated to the King's Storeroom, where a second temple guard took her out. The second kid ran in, and nearly made the same mistake, but instead went downstairs when time ran out. This temple run was also accompanied by one of Kirk Fogg's best quotes: \"He's gonna have to make up some big-time time.\"");
