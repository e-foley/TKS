This was as frustrating a loss as they come. The frontrunner was quite quick, as they should be. It's a pity that she was taken out of the temple in the Throne Room. Her partner, although he moved at decent speed, was not nearly as fast. This lack of speed did not cause the team any problems, as they got to the artifact with fifty-one seconds remaining. Instead, it was the lack of planning that cost them. After reaching the artifact, the player went up to the Observatory, but then SLOWLY made his way all the way down to the Throne Room. As he was climbing up the ladder to the Cave of Size, time was no more. A quick note: There were many episodes in Season 1 where the winning team won one and a half pendants in the temple games, but this is the only episode where Kirk Fogg announces the retrieval of the half pendant. It was placed on the Throne Room ladder; no contestant could possibly have missed it.

<p align=left><b>Contributed Summaries and Notes:</b></font><p align=left>
<font size=2>
<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
This temple run featured two fairly intelligent players that seemed to know what they were doing - until the very end. Katherine (or should I call her Fred?) went through the temple quickly until her removal in the Throne Room. Once Ron reached the Throne, he found the other half of his pendant on the ladder in that room. And he needed it - a guard was found in the Room of Fallen Columns. He went through the remaining top floor rooms and got the Chest. Things were looking great, as if victory was almost certain. But once Ron reached the Observatory, he went straight down the center shaft of the Temple to the Throne Room. Why, Ron? As he was climbing the ladder to the Cave of Size, time ran out. Side Notes: Lots of side notes for this episode. First of all, it's the only episode to feature a Temple Guard in the Room of Royal Gongs. Secondly, it's one of only [four] episodes to feature the Treasury of Golden Orbs and the Room of Fallen Columns - and it's [one of two] episodes in which the former room does NOT have a guard - the latter room had a guard in all [but one of four] episodes it appeared in. These two rooms are the two rooms of the temple that appear the LEAST out of the rooms in any season - just [four] episodes each. Also, it's the only episode to feature a half pendant on the Throne Room ladder.

<i>Aaron F.</i>:
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this run could have been a success, but because of the second runner it didn’t happen. The frontrunner did everything right; she was fast and smart. The second runner was slow and dim-witted, but he did manage to make it to the artifact. As he was exiting the pit, time ran out. Side Notes: If the Temple Run would have been a success, this would have meant that every episode in Season 1, Layout 9 would have been a win. A very rare finding of the other half pendant.
