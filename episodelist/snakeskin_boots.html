Kelly, a decent player, was removed from the temple early in the Laser Light Room. Her partner, Tony, followed the bottom route through the temple and took the diagonal Shaft-Shrine passage. The artifact was reached with fifty-two seconds left, but upon returning it, Tony was delayed by going down into the abyss where the original entrance to the Cave of Sighs was. Only five seconds remained when it was brought out of the temple, but it was a successful run nonetheless. Looking at the performance of the Purple Parrots throughout this episode, I think it's safe to say that they were downright dominant and deserved their victory.");
