He got the Diary with forty-four seconds left, and managed to escape the temple with five to spare.", "Der Kommissar", "Tabitha blazed across the bottom floor of the temple, only to be taken out by a temple spirit in the Dark Forest. After that, Brett retraced her footsteps, and after discovering that the Forest/Shrine door wouldn't open, put the key back in the tree and broke through the wall. After reaching the Shrine via the Vipers Nest, he got the Diary and ran across the top floor of the temple, took a slight detour down to Medusa's Lair, and exited the temple with just a few seconds to spare. Side Notes: Brett is one of the few players in the history of the show to enter every room of the temple during his run. Also, he's the only player (to my knowledge) that ever put the Dark Forest key BACK in the tree when he discovered that it wouldn't open the Shrine. And lastly, in the \"guessing\" temple game earlier in the episode, Baghdad is misspelled as Bagdad.","Aaron F.","This run featured two players that were fairly slow and could have used better judgment. The frontrunner Tabitha started out very slow, but did pick up speed and managed to make it to the Dark Forest. Then it was time for her partner Chris to go in. He was faster but made the mistake that many other players have made; he didn’t try the ladder in the Mine Shaft. Instead, he used the sluggish elevator that lead him to the Viper's Nest, but nonetheless, he reached the artifact and brought it out. Side notes: In the second Temple Game they were resembling how snakes (cobras) spit venom. Trip to Smugglers' Notch.");
