One thing to notice about this Temple Run is how loudly the temple guard stationed in the Laser Light Room screams (even though it's tough to miss).","The Muffin Man who Lives on Olmec Lane","Not only does the temple guard in the Laser Light Room sound like a cat after its tail has been stepped on, but it is very clearly visible \"hiding\" behind the lasers. Also, in the Crypt, do you see how the frontrunner tosses the guard a pendant, and the guard misses and is chasing after it? A classic incident in the temple run.");
