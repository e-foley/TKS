Nick only managed to make it to the King's Storeroom, but he tried something no other contestant in the show's history attempted. He took the key from the pot, and tried sticking it into the stone pillar holding the railing at the front of the room! Soon after, time expired. Twice in this run we have an obstruction that blocks the camera view, the first being the extended exit of the Laser Light Room guard and the second Chandra's retreat back to the temple gates after being removed by the Storeroom guard. Were neither choreographed? Finally, it should be noted that Chandra's completion of the Room of the Secret Password marks the only time that room's objective was completed in all of Season 2.");
