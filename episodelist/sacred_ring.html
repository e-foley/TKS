However, the side door to the Shrine did not open there, so the team was forced to go back to Medusa's Lair, where they were quite unfortunately caught by a third temple guard. If they had the second half of the pendant, the doors would have opened downwards. The Laser Light Room and the Swamp would have both opened to the left, allowing access to the artifact. There was little choice in this temple run, and unfortunately the team made the wrong one at the beginning and it cost them.", "Der Kommissar", "This temple run featured the strangest design of the entire second season. The frontrunner failed to try every book in the Crypt, and went through the first door that opened. That was the dead-end Ledges, where he lost his pendant. After getting his bearings straight and progressing to the Observatory, he was removed from the Temple. The second runner didn't spot the half pendant on the Observatory's actuator, and this cost her dearly. A third guard in Medusa's Lair ended the run. If she'd gotten the other half pendant, there's a fairly good chance she could have gotten to the Ring.", "Aaron F.", "As the frontrunner went in, he wasted a heck of a lot of time in the Ledges, which proved to be a dead end. When he finally corrected his mistake, he had burned up 30 seconds. When he was taken out, you would think his partner would be smarter... guess again. She goes down to the center of the room where she got caught by the third temple guard and the run was over. In conclusion this run featured 2 really dumb players!");
