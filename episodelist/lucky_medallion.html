He then proceeded through the top floor of the temple very quickly, and grabbed the Medallion from the Mine Shaft with forty-seven seconds left. He made it out of the temple thirty-nine* seconds later. Although this run was a solo completion, it could not have happened without Jennifer. Interestingly, this is the only episode in Season 2 where an artifact was successfully retrieved from the bottom floor.<br><span style='font-size: 10px;'>*Thanks to Bob Maibaum for the correction.</span>", "Der Kommissar", "At the beginning of the run when Ty enters the Ledges, he drops his pendant. Fortunately, his partner tossed it back to him just as a guard appeared there. He then took the high road across the temple. In the Vipers Nest, he didn't know he could just ride the elevator down, so he wasted some time there. But, he got the Medallion nonetheless and made it out of the temple before time ran out! Side Note: When the Ledges guard tries to capture Ty, the Temple Guard Capture sound effect doesn't play.");
