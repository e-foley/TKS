Besides being a bit hesitant about which doors to go through, she had a good map of the temple in her head. Unfortunately, she wasn't quick enough to get the job done, and she ran out of time in the Shrine. It's too bad that the temple design had been so difficult; with good planning skills and a simpler layout, the frontrunner would have had the Goblet out of the temple in no time. This is one of only two episodes, the other being Blackbeard's Treasure Map (1-5), where the second player never gets an opportunity to enter the temple, and the first player fails to reach the artifact. If Taylor DID get a chance to enter, he likely would have found the hidden half-pendant on Medusa's Lair's actuator. Tough luck and a tough design... That explains this run well.","Der Kommissar","This was somewhat of a boring temple run, because Rachelle (the first runner) was forced to take several vertical paths, side by side. She ran out of time after assembling the Silver Monkey, when she was just one room away from the artifact. Side Notes: After time runs out, Kirk says that Rachelle was just TWO rooms away from the artifact, when in actuality she was only ONE room away (Kirk must have forgotten about the path between the Shrine and the Mine.) Also, the other half of Taylor's pendant is on the door from the Pit to Medusa's Lair, but Taylor never got to go in the temple so he never got a chance to retrieve it. Also, this is one of the only episodes in which the first player runs out of time in the temple without reaching the artifact.");
