Jennifer races into the temple at the start and follows the bottom path until a temple guard seizes her in the Throne Room. She then passes up to the Heart Room, and races left to the Shrine where a second temple guard takes her out. A second less than two minutes remain when Jon races into the Cave of Size and follows his partner's footprints. He manages to pass through the Shrine and the Torch Room successfully, and he rides the elevator ever so slowly to the Mine Shaft. He grabs the Cannonball at forty-four seconds to go, but he takes a strange route getting back. With the seconds ticking down, Jon makes it back to the Cave of Size, DROPS THE CANNONBALL, but recovers it at the last few seconds of the run. Desperately, he darts out of the temple and through the torches for the incredible one-second win, and the trip to the Bahamas! Ironically, the team also won a telescope for their efforts.", "Der Kommissar", "This was an excellent temple run, and an extremely memorable one too. The frontrunner laid down an excellent path through the temple before being removed in the Shrine. Jon, the second runner, was equally fast, and managed to get to the Cannonball. He made the rather excellent choice of retreating along the upper floor of the temple because he thought it would be faster. In the last few seconds of the run, he drops the cannonball, but quickly recovers it and crosses the gate with one second to spare! Of all the \"one second to spare\" finishes in the history of the show, this is probably the most memorable. As a side note, when Jon enters the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, he appears to take a very close look at a small treasure chest on the shelf. I am fairly confident that this chest is the Treasure Of Ann Bonny, an artifact from the end of Season One.");
