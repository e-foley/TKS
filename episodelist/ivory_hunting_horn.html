He told Roland and Charlemagne that if they withdraw from Spain, he would pledge all obedience to France by offering them the keys to Zaragoza. Roland didn't want Charlemagne to believe him, but Charlemagne told him that Marsilion must be believed. He gave Roland an ivory hunting horn and told him to blow it if there's treachery. Soon after, the king ambushed Roland and his men. He then used his sword Durendal to strike the mountain to flee. Roland then sounded the horn and Charlemagne came back. The horn made its way to the temple. The Ivory Hunting Horn of Roland could be found in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. ";

She then raced through the bottom floor, and took the passage upwards from the Dark Forest to the Shrine, where she grabbed the artifact with 1:35 to go. Her partner, Craig, needed only to watch her finish the rest of the temple. The total time it took: One minute and forty-nine seconds, making it the second fastest completion in the history of the show.", "Der Kommissar", "This was an excellent solo temple run. The runner wasn't the smartest or fastest player in the history of the show, but it didn't make any difference - she knew what she was doing. She encountered only a single temple guard, and got the artifact out of the temple in under two minutes! Most impressive.");
