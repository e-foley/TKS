What I liked about this run is that both players were fairly smart players. The frontrunner took rocks two at a time in the Quarry, and she also went through doors that led towards the artifact. Unfortunately, it was because of this that she entered the dead-end Medusa's Lair. In the Dark Forest, the second player hesitated, and then dove to the ground and slid through the brick wall to avoid a potential temple spirit, which was also a smart move. Note: The second temple game was accompanied by the worst Fogg quote ever: \"The key to this game is... the key.\"","Der Kommissar","Here's one of those temple runs where a dead end costs the team dearly. The first runner goes up into Medusa's Lair from the Laser Light Room, only to get a double whammy - the room is both a dead end (even after completing the objective), and there is a temple guard. In the Swamp, a temple guard takes the first runner out. The second runner fares a little better. In the Dark Forest, he performs a headfirst slide to avoid the arms of the trees in case they have a Temple Guard - a smart move no other contestant ever tried. In the Mine Shaft, he took the ladder to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, but right after he put the monkey together, time ran out.");
