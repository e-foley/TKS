This run seems to tell me that the production crew overdid it. Heather started off up to the Crypt, but was forced down to the Ledges and into the Pit of Despair. In the Throne Room, she was caught by a guard, but then took a while realizing what door had opened. In Medusa's Lair, she was taken out. Then it was Tony's turn. He moved at about the same speed as his partner, but once he got to Medusa's Lair, he stalled. He spent more than a minute completing the objective, and by then victory was impossible. He passed into the King's Storeroom, but couldn't find the key before time expired. NOTE: Because of the Moat's length, heavy editing was done to the intro of the episode (it started looking towards Olmec), and is also evident in the Moat itself. A shot of a team crossing the Moat in the fog was quickly changed to a wide-angle shot of the Moat with no fog at all. Also, on a different note, the Imperial Robe of Empress Theodora is hidden in the Mineshaft throughout the episode, most easily visible after the conclusion of the mountain-climbing game.", "Der Kommissar", "This was a pretty disappointing temple run. The Blue Barracudas had won all three Temple Games and were taking two pendants to the temple. I had high hopes for them. Heather, the frontrunner, was removed from the temple just about one minute into the run in Medusa's Lair. And then in came Tony, who was a rather slow player. He entered the temple by going to the Crypt and down to the Ledges, when it would have been faster just going straight to the Ledges (too many players make this mistake.) Once he reached Medusa's Lair, he wasted more time completing the objective than any other player in the history of the show doing it - I'd say it took him at least a minute to do. In the King's Storeroom, he encountered the team's third guard, but proceeded to break the pots - which he did in a very poor fashion. He held the pots from the top and smashed them sideways with his other hand - a strategy that would have sent the key flying if he'd found it. Time ran out while he was smashing pots.","Bob Maibaum","Neither runner tried the book of the skeleton to the camera left of the temple guard's entrance in the Crypt. Also, heather got so scared by the Guard in the Throne Room, that THE GUARD HIMSELF had to show her the open door to Medusa's Lair.");
