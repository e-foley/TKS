The door on the left did not open in the Heart Room, so she was forced to climb upwards once more to the Observatory, where she was taken out. Her partner went up to the Room of the Three Gargoyles, but even here he was forced to go down. Time ran out when he was going through the Wheel Room.","Der Kommissar","This temple run featured a downright brutal layout. The frontrunner raced straight along the bottom floor of the temple into the Swamp - and the room contained both a Temple Guard and a dead end. Because of this, it took her over a minute just to get out of that room! After correcting her dead end turn and progressing up to the heart room, she wasn't even allowed access to the Treasure Room via the Heart Room! She was removed from the temple in the Observatory. The second runner wasn't able to make any additional progress before time expired.");
