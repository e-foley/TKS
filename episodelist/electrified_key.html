He tried doors leading toward the artifact, but it's because of this that he ended up in Medusa's Lair, where he met his first Temple Guard - He failed to notice that the path from the Observatory directly to the Storeroom opened. A second guard removed him from the Temple in the King's Storeroom. The second runner made a great effort to get to the Key, but time ran out just as she was preparing to enter the Throne Room, which was the Key's hiding place. If the frontrunner had never entered Medusa's Lair, this could have been a successful solo run - too bad that didn't happen.");
