This was a fantastic episode from beginning to end, but nothing could top the exciting temple run. Elizabeth started off by going up to the Crypt, and down to the Pit. Before climbing into the Laser Light Room, she signaled her partner the half pendant that lay on its actuator. She progressed up into the Room of the Mandarin Hand, where she was taken out of the temple. Her partner raced in after her removal, and went right for the half pendant. After completing the Mandarin Hand Room's objective, he raced along the top floor of the temple and grabbed the artifact with forty-four seconds remaining. He had no problem returning it to the gate. I've never seen two <i>Legends</i> contestants so happy before. On a different note, there was a very clever Kirk Fogg quote in the third temple game. It was the game where the players had to swing out on trapezes to their partners, who would take a ball attatched to their feet. Kirk started it off by commenting, "They have to meet 'em over and over and over again; this sounds like <u>Groundhog Day</u>" (referring to the movie). This episode also has my vote for weirdest title. Also, as "The Purple Parrot" has pointed out to me, this was the one and only Orange Iguanas team victory in the show's history; the others were all solo runs.

<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
This was an excellent temple run that featured two players who seemed to know what they were doing. The frontrunner managed to create a good path to the Mandarin Hand room, where she was taken out about one minute into the run. Her partner entered the temple and quickly made up for lost time, finding the other half of his pendant at the entrance to the Laser Light Room. He got the Leash and rushed to the Pit. When he found that he couldn't quite reach the rope to swing across, he made the rather smart move of using the leash to retrieve it. He won in 2:46.<p align=left>

<i>Jared Alexander</i>:
Two smart players plus an easy temple design equals a great win.<br>
Considering both of the contestants were young and shorter than most, I thought that they would not do very well, but I was wrong. Elizabeth (who did most of the work prior to the temple) raced through the Crypt and swung across the Pit. She tried doors leading to the artifact (without success) and was forced to retreat down into the Laser Light Room where she was caught by her first temple guard. She then went up to the Room of the Mandarin Hand where she was taken out of the temple. Then Jason went into the temple at a very fast speed grabbing the other half of his pendant on an actuator in the pit. Then he blazed to the Mandarin Hand and went left through the temple all the way to the Room of the Secret Password. He grabbed the dog leash and ran out of the temple even using the dog leash to help him grab the rope in the pit. He escaped the temple with time to spare. Both of the kids were super excited and greatly deserved the trip. Side notes: This whole episode was just weird. The title was weird and all the stories were weird, especially the first temple game story.<p align=left>
