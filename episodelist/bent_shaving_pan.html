So the bear tried to attack Jedediah, but Jedediah was fast and conked the bear on the head with his Shaving Pan. The bear then ran. When they got to California, Jedediah got a new shaving pan and the old one ended up in the temple. The Bent Shaving Pan could be found in the King's Storeroom.";

Unfortunately, it was here that she was removed from the temple. Her partner, Brian, simply didn't have enough time to get the job done, and so the team missed their flight to Cheeca Lodge, Florida. Note: Irish seemed to know that the temple guard was residing in the middle suit of armor, so when she was forced to fit into it, she tried to pull down the handles as quickly as possible and escape before a guard caught her. Unfortunately, her clever attempt failed.", "Der Kommissar", "There's one of those temple runs you could only define as \"so near, yet so far.\" The first player encountered a Temple Guard in the Tomb of Headless Kings (the room that [almost] ALWAYS has a Temple Guard unless the artifact is hidden there), but eventually managed to make it up to the Room of Ancient Warriors. She was just one room away, with just enough time left on the clock to get to the next room and get the treasure, but as soon as she put herself in the right suit of armor, a Temple Guard got her. Needless to say, her partner wasn't nearly fast enough to make up for the lost time. Side Notes: In the Dark Forest, the player reaches into one tree and gets the key, but you can hear eerie noises. I wonder if this was intended to imply that there was a Temple Guard in the other tree?", "Jake Potts", "Irish, the first player, ran a bit fast through the temple. Though, in the Tomb of the Headless Kings, she tried going up the ladder instead of finding the skull after pulling the ropes, but she got her head in the game and looked for the skull and found it. She made it to the Room of the Ancient Warriors, where she was caught by the second Temple Guard (and she screamed when he grabbed her) with 0:30 left on the clock. Brian wasn't fast at all, when he made it to the Dark Forest, time ran out. TOO BAD!" );
