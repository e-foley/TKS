This was one of the quirkiest episodes of all time. Here I won't be commenting on the temple run as much as the show itself. First off, Kirk obviously miscounted the first Temple Game; the Silver Snakes managed to get five gold pieces, and not the four that he counted. During the second game, Kirk kept mentioning the Snakes' difficulty to climb up the walls, because as he explained, "That's the problem, the snakes don't have any feet!" Their opposition was the Blue Barracudas, (also lacking feet, if you didn't catch the irony). Following the Temple Games was the temple run, which gave no break from the quirks...<p align=left>

By asking the team their strategy, Kirk reassured us of the great teamwork between the two players. It was this teamwork that turned out to be the key to their success. In the Throne Room the frontrunner was taken out, and the second player then progressed a full six rooms and got to the artifact! Though there were many funny things in this episode, the funniest of all was the event that happened in the last seconds of the run. Upon exiting the temple for the win, the girl took a sharp turn and slipped on the floor of the studio before crossing the temple gate.<p align=left>

During the run, Kirk managed more incorrect room names than any other episode. He called rooms by names like "The Ledge of Size," "The Temple of the Ancient Kings," and his classic "The Center of the Room." In addition to all of this, he also had some hilarious sayings during the run. When the second player was in the Room of the Golden Idols, Kirk told the second player to "Hug an idol," and in the Shrine, he said "First things first when you're assembling a monkey, huh?" This was simply a hilarious episode from beginning to end, but it was also memorable for its exciting temple run.

<p align=left><font color="brown"><b>Summary below by Mike Lowrey</b></font><p align=left>
This was one of the most exciting temple runs of the first season. The frontrunner was taken out of the temple less than a minute into the run so it became the second runner's turn rather quickly. She completed the room objectives with little or no problem. She didn't take any shortcuts but it didn't matter. She grabbed the map and fell as she approached the temple gate but got up and won the grand prize. As a side note, you can clearly see the temple guard when the second runner exits through the Cave of Size.
