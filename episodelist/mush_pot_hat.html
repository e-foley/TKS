The second player was also fairly fast, but she had a tough time climbing the Pit of Despair's walls. She got the artifact with twenty-plus seconds to go, but she couldn't get past the Ledges before time expired. If it were not for the problems she had in the Pit, this could have been a very close finish.", "Der Kommissar", "This run featured two fairly fast players that knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, the frontrunner was removed just four rooms into the temple, leaving the second runner to make up for lost time. She got the Mush Pot, with 21 seconds left on the clock, and blazed through the temple back toward the entrance in what little time she had left, but time expired just as she was entering the low crawl tube to the Ledges. Had the frontrunner started this run by entering the Ledges rather than the Crypt, it probably could have been a successful run. An interesting note - In Olmec's Temple summary and in the end credits, you can clearly see a camera man in the Crypt. Likewise, when the second runner trips while moving up from the Storeroom to the Observatory, she trips and breaks the handle off of the Mush Pot.","Doug E. Fresh","This layout was almost similar to The Medal of Sir Edmund Hillary because the door to the left of the Shrine of the Silver Monkey didn’t open. Angela took the Shrine-Mine Shaft passage and was forced to ride the slower than a turtle elevator. Because of this, victory was impossible. She would have to ride the elevator, grab the hat, and exit through the Ledges from the pit because this run had no bridge unlike The Medal run (and the rope swing wasn’t introduced yet). Unfortunately, two good players were robbed because of a tough layout.");
