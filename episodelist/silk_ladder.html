I can't really say much more.","Der Kommissar","This run featured players of average skill, but because the temple was arranged in a pretty simple design, they achieved victory. The frontrunner started high, but was forced to detour low. She was removed in the Heart Room. The second runner followed his partner's steps, and got the ladder with 1:02 to go. From that point on, he rushed out of the temple along the high road, escaping with 0:33 to spare.","Doug E. Fresh","Hit a tongue, climb a ledge, hit a button, go through a crawl tube, climb a wheel to raise a rock slab, hit another button, go through another crawl tube, sit on a throne, climb an easy ladder, hit another button, go through another crawl tube, hit yet another button, grab the cloth, and escape. Yeah, not an impressive victory. I think The Mask of Shaka Zulu was a more impressive win, and that one had a production error that helped the team win.");
