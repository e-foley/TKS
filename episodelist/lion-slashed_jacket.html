They just ignored Sacagawea and went on their way. But, in the forest they came across a mountain lion. The men tried shooting it, but it didn't hurt the lion. They ran with their lives and sooner or later, the lion cornered them. Just then, Sacagawea was there to save the day. The lion kept swiping at them and it sliced through Sacagawea's buckskin jacket. The lion went away and the jacket made it's way to the temple. The Lion-Slashed Jacket of Sacagawea could be found in the Room of the Secret Password.";
