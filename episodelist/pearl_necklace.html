They fought for a year, but the British pushed the Rani back to her Fortress. The Rani then decided to take over the General's place. She called for her sword, her two pistols and The Pearl Necklace of Gwalior. The necklace symbolized her right to reign. When the men saw the Rani, they roared and fought the British even harder. The British wanted to kill her, but the commander didn't want to because she was so brave. For days, the Rani held the city against the assault. She then slipped from the city and The Pearl Necklace of Gwalior disappeared. The Pearl Necklace could be found in the Quicksand Bog.";
