He raced to where his partner left off, assembled the monkey, took the ladder to the Dark Forest, found the key, and opened the door to the Jester\'s Court quite quickly. With the seconds ticking down, he aligned himself to the middle painting to no avail, and then tried the one on the left, also not working. He then glanced at the painting on the right and tried the center one again. This time it worked, but with only seconds remaining. He raced into the Tomb and grabbed the watch.
