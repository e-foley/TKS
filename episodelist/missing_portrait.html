Henry had 6 wives, of which he divorced 2, did away with 3, and 1 died under mysterious circumstances.<b>*</b> After Holbein completed his first portrait of Henry, the King protested that Holbein had painted him unflatteringly. Henry said he looked fat enough to be Henry XVI, and that Holbein must've liked his chin because he painted 2 more just like it. Holbein said his portrait was accurate to Henry's appearance. However, after Henry threatened to imprison Holbein and boil him in oil, Holbein relented and started work on another painting which to this day hangs at England's Royal Palace. The old painting disappeared shortly thereafter. The Missing Portrait could be found in the Chamber of the Sacred Markers.<br /><br /><b>*Bob's Note</b>: The fates of Henry VIII's wives were incorrect in the legend. In real life, Henry VIII divorced 2, had 2 beheaded, 1 died mysteriously, and the last wife survived. This lead to the popular mnemonic device \"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived\".";

In the final game, the team's members had to become vandals and smash Henry VIII's statues by having one member grab a boulder, throw it up to their partner, who would catch the boulder then fly towards the statues and throw the boulder at them.";
