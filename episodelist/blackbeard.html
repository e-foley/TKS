He would light his own ship on fire when he was bored, and shot his own crew members to keep them on their toes. He would attack Spanish ships to steal their valuables, and would mutilate people who didn't hand them over quickly enough. After his attacks, he would row ashore with a few men to help bury the treasure, and sometimes killed those who helped him bury it. The last of his 14 wives held the map to his treasure.

After raising the slab in the Wheel Room, the door behind it was locked. She retreated back to the Cave of Sighs and went up to the Room of the Three Gargoyles. In here, she pressed on all three tongues, but the door to the left didn't budge. After taking a long time forcing open the door, she made her way to the Heart Room with a minute left. Instead of looking for the open door down into the Throne Room, she went backwards to the Troubled Bridge again, where time ran out. I expected MUCH more out of this team, as they had won two pendants!", "Der Kommissar", "This temple run was a disaster from start to finish. The player was slow-witted, slow moving, and extremely unlucky. The team had won two pendants, but the frontrunner wasted all of the team's time searching through five rooms and making no additional progress. The second runner didn't even get to enter the temple! In conclusion, this temple run is one of many examples of why you NEVER send the slow-witted player into the temple first.");
