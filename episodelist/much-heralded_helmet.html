Although he was younger and not as smart as some of the other Knights, his magical silver helmet gave him a competitive edge. This helmet was so powerful that it was coveted by Merlin the Wizard because its power surpassed his. One day, King Arthur's wife Guinevere approached Gawain with news that a pane of stained glass had been stolen from the royal chamber, and asked him to find the thief. After a little bickering, Gawain accepted the task. While searching for the thief, he stumbled upon a scullery maid who told him that she had broken the pane, and was fearful of the punishment she'd receive. This led to Gawain helping the maid by relinquishing his helmet to Merlin in exchange for him repairing the pane with magic. The Much-Heralded Helmet could be found in the Jester's Court.";

She moved through the rooms one after the other, and intelligently took the ladder from the Shrine to the Forest. She found the key and opened the door to the Court, grabbing the Helmet with fifty-three seconds to go. She did not go as quickly as expected through the rooms on her exit, but that was understandable considering the size of the artifact. She climbed from the pitch-black Ledges to the Crypt, and then through the gates with twelve seconds remaining. She never encountered a temple guard! In the average temple run summary, I comment on how it \"would have helped the team is they had done (blank),\" but this run was full of smart moves. In addition to taking the ladder from the Shrine to the Forest, Tiffani also was able to swing back to the platform after using the Pit's pendulum. If that did not happen, this would not have been a win. On a different note, after introducing the players at the start of the temple games, Kirk executed a Snagglepuss-like \"Exit stage right!\" when of course, the players exited stage left. Classic.","Der Kommissar","Tiffany wasn't the fastest player in the world, but she had a good map of the Temple in her head. She knew right where to go, and managed to get to the helmet by only passing through seven rooms - not bad at all. Her partner didn't even have to go into the temple, but if he did, chances are he would have found the half pendant hidden in the Chamber of the Sacred Markers. A few extra notes - Only two players in the history of the show ever successfully retrieved an artifact from the room space that contains the Jester's Court. The other was Lawrence Of Arabia's Headdress (1-9.) On a second note, this is one of the few Season Three episodes that uses the alternate pre-Temple Run footage, also seen in the Battle Flag of William The Conqueror and the War Fan of the 47 Ronin. Lastly, this marks one of only three episodes in the entire series in which the runner does not encounter a single Temple Guard - The others of which being the Enormous Iron Nosering Of Babe The Ox and the Broken Trident Of Poseidon.","Bob Maibaum","This might not interest anyone, but even after grabbing the helmet, the door that opens up to the ladder from the Chamber of the Sacred Markers to the King's Storeroom did not open! This is clearly seen as Tiffani is entering The Tomb of the Headless Kings as well as during the end credits.");
