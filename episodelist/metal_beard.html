Because no woman had ever ruled Egypt before, Hatshepsut dressed like a man, with a black wig and false metal beard. She went on to build the first ever zoo and many great libraries and temples, all adorned with statues of herself. One night, Hatshepsut and her son Thutmose III<b>*</b> were sitting around the Pyramids, and she started badgering him about eating properly so he could grow up to be a good Pharaoh. Thutmose responded that he'd already be Pharaoh if she'd let him, and her reply being that he wasn't old enough, to which he responded that he was 33 years old at the time. He cited examples of fellow friends from his youth being rulers already, to which she noted how poorly their countries were doing. Thutmose III didn't become Pharaoh until several years later, becoming a powerful leader, but hating his Mother<b>*</b> for impeding his rule. As a result, he ordered that all statues of her be destroyed, and the only reminder left afterward was her metal beard. The Metal Beard could be found in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. <br /><br /> <b>*Bob's Note</b>: The relationship between Hatshepsut and Thutmose III was incorrect in the legend. Thutmose III was the stepson of Hatshepsut, not her biological son.";

After snatching the artifact, Randy took a very unusual route out of the temple. She raced through the Room of the Ancient Warriors, climbed up to the King's Storeroom, descended into the Chamber of the Sacred Markers, jumped into the Pit of the Pendulum, climbed into the Ledges, and then took the ladder up to the Crypt before exiting. Besides being a mess to talk about, Randy also accomplished something with her odd route out of the temple: she entered all 12 rooms! One small note: When the Silver Snakes answered their first question correctly in the Steps of Knowlege, Olmec replied with \"You got it, kids\" instead of his usual \"That is correct.\"");
