This was a superb episode from beginning to end. Tiffani wasn't the fastest temple runner in the world, but it didn't matter. She moved through the rooms one after the other, and intelligently took the ladder from the Shrine to the Forest. She found the key and opened the door to the Court, grabbing the Helmet with fifty-three seconds to go. She did not go as quickly as expected through the rooms on her exit, but that was understandable considring the size of the artifact. She climbed from the pitch-black Ledges to the Crypt, and then through the gates with twelve seconds ramaining. She never encountered a temple guard! In the average temple run summary, I comment on how it "would have helped the team is they had done (blank)," but this run was full of smart moves. In addition to taking the ladder from the Shrine to the Forest, Tiffani also was able to swing back to the platform after using the Pit's pendulum. If that did not happen, this would not have been a win. On a different note, after introducing the players at the start of the temple games, Kirk executed a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Snagglepuss"><font color="black">Snagglepuss</font></a>-like "Exit stage right!" When of course, following the play, the players exited stage left. Classic.

<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
Tiffany wasn't the fastest player in the world, but she had a good map of the Temple in her head. She knew right where to go, and managed to get to the helmet by only passing through seven rooms - not bad at all. Her partner didn't even have to go into the temple, but if he did, chances are he would have found the half pendant hidden in the Chamber of the Sacred Markers. A few extra notes - Only two players in the history of the show ever successfully retrieved an artifact from the room space that contains the Jester's Court. The other was Lawrence Of Arabia's Headdress (1-9.) On a second note, this is one of the few Season Three episodes that uses the alternate pre-Temple Run footage, also seen in the Battle Flag of William The Conqueror and the War Fan of the 47 Ronin. Lastly, this marks one of only three episodes in the entire series in which the runner does not encounter a single Temple Guard - The others of which being the Enormous Iron Nosering Of Babe The Ox and the Broken Trident Of Poseidon.

<i>Bob Maibaum</i>: This might not interest anyone, but even after grabbing the helmet, the door that opens up to the ladder from the Chamber of the Sacred  Markers to the King's Storeroom did not open! This is clearly seen as Tiffani is entering The Tomb of the Headless Kings as well as during the end credits.
