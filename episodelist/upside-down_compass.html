The men complained and promised mutiny if they didn't turn back. Hudson just ignored them. John then took Hudson's compass and spun the base around so it looked like he was heading south. So Henry went south and everyone was happy. They explored the Northwest Passage and the upside-down compass ended up in the temple. The Upside-Down Compass could be found in the Dark Forest.";

The Parrots had to face a difficult Temple; the rooms they were forced into took a substantial amount of time to complete. The frontrunner, while often hesitant, fared quite well in the temple, and managed to make it to her sixth room, the King's Storeroom, where she was removed by a temple guard. The second runner was certainly quick, but took two turns that slowed the team's progress. First, instead of entering the Ledges directly, he went up to the Crypt and then downwards. Secondly, the door from the Pit of the Pendulum to the Chamber of the Sacred Markers had opened after the frontrunner completed the Chamber's objective, but the second player neglected to take the open shortcut. He ran out of time in the Shrine, where at the last second he dropped the middle piece of the monkey to the Dark Forest. Tough luck.");
