Wheeland took out his dreaded hornpipe. Wheeland then took over Greenwood's ship and only three men and Wheeland stayed aboard with Greenwood to count their booty. Wheeland wanted Greenwood's cargo, but Greenwood couldn't remember, though he had a list in the cabin. Wheeland took Greenwood to the cabin and locked Wheeland and his men inside. He threw the mate overboard and pirates surrounding him began firing. Greenwood dodged the musket balls, cut the ship free and sailed away.

He had no trouble putting the monkey together, and after doing so, he went into the Room of the Secret Password. He promptly realized his mistake, and then went back and took the Shrine/Bog passage to the artifact. After grabbing it with just thirty-five seconds to spare, he decided to go back up the way he came in and continue across the top floor of the temple to its exit.
