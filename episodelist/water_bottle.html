This one was difficult because of the placement of the temple guards. The frontrunner started off to the Room of the Three Gargoyles, and then speedily progressed along the top floor of the temple, being caught by a guard in the Observatory on his way. He took the ladder down from the Pirates' Cove, and then followed the bottom path as fast as he could. Once he entered the Room of Harmonic Convergence, he was just a ladder's distance away from the Water Bottle. However, just after trying the first set of steps, a temple guard emerged and captured him, removing him from the temple. His partner couldn't make it past the Treasure Room in the thirty-eight seconds she had.","Der Kommissar","The frontrunner was a smart player who seemed to know what he was doing, but he made a fatal mistake that cost the team victory. After assembling the Silver Monkey, he failed to see that the door to the Tomb opened - so he went through the Pirates' Cove and Dungeon before finally getting to the Tomb. In the Harmonic Convergence Room, a second temple guard ended the run. The second runner was rather stupid (watch the episode and you'll see what I mean), and furthermore had no prayer of making up for the lost time. Side Note: Just listen to the first runner scream when he encounters his first Temple Guard!","El Short Guy","Like the others said, the layout was brutal. Since he had already gone through 9 rooms, and the item room never has a guard, he was going to meet a guard in the Room of Harmonic Convergence no matter what. He made good time throughout the whole thing. His only mistake was missing the Shrine to [the Tomb of Ancient Kings] door. The second runner only had 36 or so seconds when he was taken out so there was no way she could have progressed further. She made some weird choices within her given time though. Finally, the frontrunner really did have one of the best reactions in the entire series. This may have caused his notable apprehension of the doors opening later on.");
