In the mid 1500's, he arrived in South America and led 900 men across the Columbian jungle seeking gold. They met up with the Chibcha tribe, a peaceful people who offered the Spaniards their gold freely. However, the Spanish men were greedy, and soon started taking more gold by force. But they didn't know the source of the Chibcha's gold, so Quesada had the Chibcha Chieftain and his assistant brought to him in chains, demanding the whereabouts of the source of their gold. After threats made against the Chieftain, he agreed to tell Quesada where their gold was sourced. He started to lie that the gold came from the lost golden city of El Dorado, and even offered to draw Quesada a map showing how to get there. Quesada soon left with his men in search of El Dorado, and were never seen again. The Useless Map could be found in the Dark Forest.";

(Elizabeth the First's Golden Ship (1-2) still holds rights to that record.) After Hallie started by going up to the Crypt, she was immediately caught by a temple guard who nearly took her out of the temple! She gave it her pendant, and continued onwards. She did not keep going for long, however, as a guard was also stationed in the Tomb of the Headless Kings, removing her from the temple. Then it was Jared's turn to enter. He completed the objectives in the Tomb of the Headless Kings and the Chamber of the Sacred Markers, but was taken out in the King's Storeroom to end the run. As an interesting note, there were not many episodes where a team won a single pendant. However, this is one of only two episodes in the one-pendant volume where the team was taken out on three guards. The other is The Pendant of Kamehameha (1-3).","Der Kommissar","One of the quickest losses in Legends history. The first player is taken out of the temple in no time at all, and the second player gets taken out not long after. There is over a minute remaining on the clock when they lose. Side Notes: Because the loss was so soon, the end credits scroll by very slowly to make up for lost time.");
