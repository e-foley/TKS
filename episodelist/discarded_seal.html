Then it was enthusiastic Elisa's turn to enter. She only had enough time to progress to the Room of the Ancient Warriors and try the first two sets of armor before time ran out. However, to the team's credit, they entered a total of nine rooms, which is incredible for a Season 3 run. Note: When the frontrunner tries aligning himself with the first wall painting, he accidentally knocks off the foot actuator.","Doug E. Fresh","I already mentioned that The Marble Armrest of Xerxes was one of the hardest layouts the show has ever had, but this run was the hardest of them all. Reason why: it was an impossible layout with two very good players. Why was it impossible? This solid team was denied of almost all shortcuts (the only one they were given access to was the Bog-Shrine passage) and the temple guard placement was flat out brutal. When Travis knocked over the column in the pit, the only door that opened was the Chamber of the Sacred Markers, and Travis made it back to the ledge without falling into the pit. This room had the first temple guard. After completing each room’s objectives quickly, Travis took the Bog-Shrine passage, where he met his second temple guard. Elise quickly made it to where Travis was taken out. With about fifteen seconds remaining, she made it into the Room of the Ancient Warriors, just one room away from the seal. Then something very cruel happened. The first suit of armor she tried had the third temple guard, and unlike most runs, this suit didn’t open anything. The second suit didn’t work, and when she was fitting herself into the third suit, time had run out. Simply put, this is the hardest layout in the entire show, and this run had two very good players. Talk about bad luck.");
