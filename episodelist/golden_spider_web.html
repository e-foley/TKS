While the team could have made more progress by having the second player enter directly into the Crypt, they would still have had to pass through nine rooms before the artifact's, as the Shrine-Bog door opened, but not the Shrine-Forest one. Furthermore, the team, entering with one and a half pendants, was essentially required to nab the hidden half pendant on the left of the Pit-Storeroom passage doorway because the three temple guards were inevitable. The team itself was above-average in terms of speed, but unfortunately, that wasn't enough to let them succeed here. On a more comical note, however, Kirk Fogg accidentally mentioned \"dreaded temple games\" instead of \"guards\" following his introduction of the two competing teams prior to the temple games.", "Michael Hackney", "Jeremy is all to blame for this loss for two reasons. One, he passed up the half-pendant which was in plain sight as it was nailed to the wall (viewer's left) in the Pit. Two, in the individual game in which he competed, he cost the Green Monkeys the full pair of pendants by blatantly cheating. It was the temple game where the teams had to climb that tower where they jumped up on a trampoline and crawled through a large hole in netting (they had to go through either three or four, not sure about which one it was). In this version, the first person to reach the top of the tower and place a (fake) spider on the front of it got his team the half-pendant. Jeremy had an insurmountable lead going into the last hole to crawl through. Then, he did perhaps the dumbest thing any player did in any of the temple games--instead of going through the proper opening, he took a shortcut, and slithered between the platform at the top, and a pole to which the netting was attached. Everyone saw this, Kirk made him go back, and by the time he reached the top, he'd already lost. Then again, I don't know why the temple guards were so darn picky about a player just having a half-pendant. Couldn't they have been rewarded the other half as a bonus for getting to the temple? Their focus was more on getting the artifact and getting out without running out of time or seeing a temple guard. I don't, though, sympathize with those teams who went in with only one pendant. Some of those teams actually made that work out well (i.e. the Secret Map of the Bandit Queen and the Metal Beard of the Egyptian Queen episodes).", "Jake Potts", "This was the most stupidest run ever. I'll tell you why, because of the Green Monkey, Jeremy. First, during the first temple game, it was the one where you climbed that giant maze and go through obstacles. When he was going through it near the end, he was stupid and decided to play unfairly by going through the shortcut, and Kirk made him go back. And second, he past the half pendant in the Pit, and that cost him to be caught by a third temple guard. Though, it sucked the Spider Web was hidden in the Chamber, and the producers made them go the hard way.");
