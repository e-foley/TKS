Chris volunteered to head into the temple first, and made great time as he climbed through the Ledges and took the bottom floor to the Dark Forest, and then passed upwards to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. Unfortunately, it was here that he was taken out, and so it was Ryann\'s turn to enter the temple. However, she did something completely unexpected. She took a different route and raced up to the Crypt, where she was seized by the team\'s third temple guard. What a waste! This is the only episode where a team\'s third temple guard was hidden in an entrance room. An interesting note: When Olmec asked who was going into the temple first, Chris replied with his own name, and not the traditional \"I am.\"", "Der Kommissar", "There were a ton of Temple Runs with unusual finishes, but this one just takes the cake. The frontrunner was making pretty good progress through the temple, but got taken out by a second guard. The second runner instantaneously made the mistake that cost them victory. With only half a pendant, she went up to the CRYPT (not the Ledges where her partner had started.) In that room, a third guard ended the run! No other Temple Runs were ended by a guard in the entrance rooms. That one little mistake made this one of the quickest losses in the show's history.","Mike Lowrey","This episode definitely shows how important it is to follow the frontrunner's path. Chris, the frontrunner, made excellent time in the temple. I thought for sure this would be a successful run. He started off in the Ledges and made his way to the Laser Light Room, where a guard caught him. Upon making it to the Dark Forest, he took the ladder leading to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, where he was taken out. The second runner, Ryann, did something totally stupid, which cost them the game. Instead of simply following Chris' path, she went up the stairs to the Crypt, where a guard resided and was taken out with 1:20 remaining. What a shame!");
