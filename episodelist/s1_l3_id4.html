You can't help but feel sorry for this team. Robbie was very speedy, but had terrible luck. He was removed from the temple in his fourth room, in less than half a minute. Then followed his partner Tina. She was not as fast as her partner, but had a good map of the temple in her head. She took the long route around the temple, through the Pirate's Cove and the Dungeon, and at last she made it to the Tomb. But then, something completely unexpected (and rediculous) happened: A lazy temple guard from the DUNGEON slowly trotted into the Tomb to end the run. Temple runs do not get any more unfair than this.

<font size=2>
<i>Der Kommissar</i>:
On your mark, get set, GO! Robbie raced into the temple, carrying the only pendant that he and his partner had won in the Temple Games. He blazed through the temple at a speed I have never seen any other contestant move at. Sadly though, he was removed from the temple in the Heart Room, just 26 seconds into the run. And then Tina came in. She wasn't nearly as fast as Robbie and stalled a bit going through the rooms, but was still a decent player. For reasons unknown she entered the Temple via the Gargoyle room and NOT the cave - a move that would have proven tragic if a guard had been there. Still, she continued to cruise through the temple along the top floor. Once she entered the Pirates Cove, she spun the wheel and descended into the Dungeon. She then plowed through the wall and entered the Tomb Of Ancient Kings, with the artifact just one room away, but got a nasty surprise - A Temple Guard emerged from the Dungeon, putting an end to this run with roughy 53 seconds left on the clock. To put it simply, this team didn't make very many mistakes - it was their lack of a second pendant that cost them. Side notes: The team entered every room of the temple other than the Spider's Lair. Likewise, this is the only episode to ever feature a Temple Guard in the Dungeon.<p align=left>

<i>Bob Maibaum</i>:
I think I know why the third temple guard in [this episode] was so slow in emerging. If you look at the tape, you
notice that when Tina descends into the Dungeon, she steps on a big
lump of tarp. My theory is that the temple guard door was stuck shut
due to non-use or had been sealed shut or been marked off-limits for
some reason, and they made up by hiding the Guard al a Quicksand Bog
under the blue tarp and covered him up. My guess is that when Tina
stepped onto the Dungeon floor she stood right on top of his "trap door
spider" mechanism, and the Guard wasn't able to lift her weight, so he
waited until she busted through the wall to avoid upending her, then
emerged to capture her. My other guess is that the Guard was hiding al
a Quicksand Bog behind the other big lump of tarp in the rear left
corner of the Dungeon, and just missed his cue. And isn't it ironic that in this temple run, the artifact was THE EXACT THING that the Silver Snakes lacked.
