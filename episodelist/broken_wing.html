He didn't want Icarus to fly too high or his wings would melt since they were made from wax. But when Icarus was in the air, he forgot what his father said, so Icarus flew around seeing things he wanted to see, but Daedalus kept calling him to come down. As Icarus got higher, the sun melted his wings and he fell down. The only thing that was left of Icarus was a broken wing which ended up in the temple. The Wing could be found in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.";

However, he exited the temple rather slowly, and took difficult routes. After squeezing his body through the Ledges, he ran towards the gate, only to find that time had run out when he was behind Olmec.","Doug E. Fresh","This is one of those runs where it should’ve been a win, but it wasn’t because of one player’s bad exit strategy. Jason wasn’t bad despite one wrong turn into the Observatory. He got the wing with fifty-six seconds left and I thought for sure this was going to be an easy win, but nooooo. Jason had to mess everything up with his awful exit plan. Instead of using the rope swing to get into the Crypt, Jason dropped down into the pit and went into the Ledges. He dawdled around too much in the Ledges and it cost him dearly. Time ran out when he was behind Olmec. You just got to feel bad for his partner April. She never got to enter the temple and she had to witness one of the biggest screw ups in the show’s history. Talk about heartbreak.");
