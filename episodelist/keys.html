He speedily progressed through the bottom floor of the temple, but was taken out in the Tomb of Ancient Kings just thirty-one seconds into the run. Second came Lisa. She slowly made it to where her partner had left off, but did not realize that she could ascend from the Tomb to the Shrine. After spending nearly a minute in the Tomb--guess what?--she went backwards! And when I say backwards, I mean all the way back to the door of the Cave of Sighs! Enough said. This is one of those episodes where I wish the team ran into a third guard to face a more honorable fate than an excruciating waste of time. It is also one of the few episodes where the wall between the Tomb and the Dungeon does not break down.","Der Kommissar","The first player blazes through the bottom floor of the temple straight to the Tomb of Ancient Kings, where he is taken out. Had he not been taken out, the team would have had a better chance of winning. The second runner was one of the show's many slow-witted contestants, and failed to notice that the door to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey was open (the wall wouldn't break down.) Because of this she goes ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE WALL CLIMB, and even tries to exit the temple through the Cave of Sighs. Too bad she wasn't more like the first runner. Needless to say, time ran out.");
