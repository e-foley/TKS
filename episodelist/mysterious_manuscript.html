Kate made it all the way to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey before being removed from the temple, and Larry took over with 1:13 to go. At the Pit, he made a smart move and climbed up to the King's Storeroom instead of going to the Chamber and taking time climbing the ladder. He made it into the Shrine with a full thirty-nine seconds remaining. He was just a room away from the artifact! Unfortunately, he had incredible difficulty assembling the monkey. The base was sideways, the belly was upside-down, and the head was reversed, but he tried forcing it down with all his might anyway! Although Olmec's legend spoke much of Frankenstein, Larry wasn't supposed to make the monkey resemble him. He wasted the rest of the run here.", "Der Kommissar", "The Blue Barracudas had two pendants, and I was really hoping they would do better than they did. Kate, though rather enthusiastic about gaining access to Olmec's temple, was a pretty hesitant and often confused player, and this cost the team dearly. She lost her pendant in the Chamber of the Sacred Markers, and was taken out of the temple in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. Larry passed up the Chamber altogether and took the route straight through the King's Storeroom, and reached the Shrine with forty seconds left. Unfortunately, he had more trouble putting the monkey together than any other player in Legends history - it took him a long time to get the base straight, and even then, he had the belly twisted - and kept trying to jam the head on anyway! It was an unsuccessful run, but Larry's rather pathetic attempt to assemble the monkey makes this a good temple run due to its comedy value.");
