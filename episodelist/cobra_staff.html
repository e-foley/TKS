In the Heart Room, she proceeded to go downwards to the Throne Room. She then realized that she was stuck. She looked around for an exit, and even tried breaking through the stone slab that covered the door to the Wheel Room! After finding her way out, she made it to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, where she was taken out. Her partner made up some great time, and even got to the artifact. Unfortunately, he could only enter the Holes of Python when time expired. Note: As \"The Purple Parrot\" has pointed out, the half-pendant was on the actuator connecting the Treasure Room to the Shrine.", "Der Kommissar","Yet another example of \"Why you never send the slow-witted player into the Temple first.\" The frontrunner in this run was slow and made some pretty dumb moves. Fortunately, her partner managed to make up for lost time. He reached the Cobra Staff, but his partner had wasted so much time that he was only able to enter the Python Holes when time expired.", "El Short Guy", "Wasted talent is what this run basically was. After wasting some time in the Royal Gong Room, she reached the Observatory but none of the doors would open (possibly due to a production error). Eventually, the door to the Heart Room opened. This is where most of her troubles occurred. The door to the Treasure Room would have been open if she had hit the actuator but instead, she went down to the Throne Room. Some time later, she finally opened the Throne Room door and progressed all the way to the Shrine but was stopped there by her second temple guard. The second runner was a bit indecisive at times but nowhere near that of his partner. He managed to reach the staff after a slow descent in the bucket but could only go into the Holes of Python when time ran out. Altogether, were it not for the frontrunner's mistakes and that error, a full 45 seconds could have been saved, which may have given our man the time he needed to exit the temple.");
