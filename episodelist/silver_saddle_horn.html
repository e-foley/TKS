Hannibal told his advisor Mumbo that he dreamt he was flying on something gray with wings and he crushed the city of Rome. Mumbo then said to gather an army of elephants and to travel through the Alps to Rome. This seemed like a good idea to Hannibal and he bought 38 elephants. The dealer was so pleased he gave Hannibal a silver saddle horn. Hannibal won the battle and gave Mumbo the saddle horn. The Silver Saddle Horn could be found in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.";

I acknowledge the team for trying to head for rooms leading toward the artifact, but luck was against them; the frontrunner got caught up in a massive dead end which destroyed all chance of a victory. Although she moved at an acceptable speed, it didn't matter--the second player could not even make it through a room of his own.,","Der Kommissar","This episode broke my heart for two reasons. First of all, the British player Lee (from the Green Monkeys) didn't make it to the temple. Second of all, the frontrunner from the Red Jaguars ruined any chance the team may have had of winning the temple. She blazed through the temple, but went up at the Throne Room, and by this move, unintentionally decided the outcome of the run. In the Treasure Room, she lost her pendant to a guard. The Shrine doors didn't open, so she went back to the Heart Room where she retreated to the Observatory - a very stupid move. Eventually she got her act together and retreated to the Throne and entered the Python Holes, but a second Temple Guard ended her run there. Her partner, Damon, raced into the Python Holes, but was unable to make any more progress. Had the frontrunner NOT gone upwards in the Throne Room, chances are she could have set a Legends record - too bad that didn't happen.");
