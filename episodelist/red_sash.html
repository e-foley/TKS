The castle was then destroyed, and Yoritomo was brought to Ieyasu in chains. Ieyasu told him that the penalty for disobeying the Shogun was to behead. Ieyasu then told him that if he were to swear allegiance to him, Ieyasu would restore his land and title and spare his life. Yoritomo then pledged his support. Ieyasu then gave Yoritomo his red sash. The Red Sash could be found in the Tomb of the Headless Kings.";

In the Pit of the Pendulum, she had enough momentum to make it back to the platform after her swing, which saved loads of time. However, after completing the objective in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, she made a big blunder. The doors to the Dark Forest did not open, so she checked the door leading to the Quicksand Bog. After starting to pass through the door, she changed her mind and instead went into the Room of the Secret Password, where she was taken out. Quentin was determined, but instead of taking the already open Shrine/Bog passage, he also went into the next room, and then took the Pharaoh's Secret Passage down to the Bog, where he gave up his pendant. With little time left, he raced through the Forest and got lucky in the Court. The door opened to the Tomb, but just as he was climbing through it, time expired. If it weren't for Brandy's mistake, this could have been a successful run. What may have added to Brandy's confusion is that the doors from the Shrine to the Secret Password Room opened even before she assembled the monkey.");
