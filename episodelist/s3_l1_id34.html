<font size=2>Once upon a time, in an ancient Mayan temple, there were three temple guards. They had a difficult and boring life, patiently guarding different areas of their King's temple every day. The temple functioned as the shrine of a sacred trident, believed to be that of Poseidon's, which required heavy guarding to protect it from the area's thieves. However, after one particularly boring day of work, the temple guards had had enough. They secretly planned to take a vacation--just one fun-filled day--and hope that nobody would attempt to steal the trident. They all left in the middle of the night, as not to be seen...<p align=left>

However, the next morning, two children came up to the side of the temple, by the names of Kimberly and Tony. They had long been mystified by the giant temple, and each had an insatiable internal urge to explore its interior. Being children, they did not recognize the consequences at hand. Kimberly had the courage to head into the temple first, with the foresight that if both went in at once, they would be far too noticeable by the guards. She silently tiptoed to the entrance, and slipped into the darkness.<p align=left>

She explored many mysterious rooms--a room of long-forgotten kings since transformed into headless skeletons, a dark and mysterious basin of quicksand, a mysterious shrine evidently dedicated to a silver monkey figurine--before finally coming to a broken piece of metal, in the shape of an ancient trident. "Ooooh! This is pretty! I'd love to show this to Tony as quickly as possible," she thought, and snatched it from its resting place. But as soon as she laid her hands on the trident, she heard a violent noise, as if every door in the temple had opened at once. Tension filled her muscles, and the instinct to run for her life seeped into her brain like a towel in a pail of water. Charging through the rooms at full throttle, the trident slipped out of her sweaty hands and to the dirty floor below. Oblivious to this until she had passed to the next room, she hurriedly returned back to where she had dropped the ancient artifact and continued onwards hastily in a flurry of desperation. Before long she found herself at the cliff of a large pit, but without another option, flung herself into it. She tried desperately, with all her force, to escape, but her time was up...<p align=left>
THE END<p align=left>

The moral of the story: Never send the slow-witted player first into the temple.</font>

<p align=left><font color="darkgreen"><b>Summary below by Der Kommissar:</b></font><p align=left>

This temple run went well for the first two minutes, and ended up having a very disappointing outcome. Kimberly was making good progress along the bottom floor of the Temple. She got the Trident with fifty seconds left, and then, disaster. She didn't realize that all of the Temple's doors had unlocked when she had gotten the Trident, and tried fitting herself into a suit of armor in the Room of the Ancient Warriors. When she did this, she set the Trident down. And as soon as she realized all the doors were open, she took off running - WITHOUT THE TRIDENT. She made it all the way to the Chamber before she realized she had to go back and get it! Because of her critical error, time expired before she could escape the Temple. If I can say one good thing about this episode, it's that it's one of only three episodes in the entire series in which the player doesn't encounter a single Temple Guard.
