In 1847, Douglass founded the New York newspaper \"The North Star\". One evening, a group of men burst into the North Star's office, demanding to see the paper's Editor. When Douglass identified himself as the Editor, the men told him that they didn't like what the North Star had been printing, and had come to trash the place. Before they could get started, Douglass told them that he'd just reopen the paper elsewhere and that if he was stopped, others would take his place. To prove his point, Douglass smashed one of his own printing presses himself. This caused the mob to disperse in embarrassment. Douglass kept a shard of the smashed printing plate as a keepsake. The Smashed Printing Plate could be found in the Tomb of the Headless Kings.";

One small note: The players should still have to shout out the correct password when entering from the Shrine to open the Pharaoh's Secret Passage, but the frontrunner didn't do it here.","Michael Hackney","That Printing Plate, while plastic, was huge! Imagine if one of the two players had gotten to the plate. That would've been a fight trying to get through the Pit, as they would've not only been trying not to fall over the foam blocks, but also trying not to trip over the plate itself. Going through the Ledges might've been an even worse fight, considering how tight it was in there.");
