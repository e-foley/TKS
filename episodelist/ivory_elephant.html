Like almost all other episodes, it would have helped the team out if they had taken the Shrine/Dark Forest passage instead of the long way. Also, if the second player had run up directly to the Crypt after the frontrunner was removed from the temple, that would have saved time as well. As a final note: If the team managed to reach the Ivory Elephant, they would have visited all twelve rooms getting there.", "Der Kommissar", "You know what happens almost every time an artifact is hidden at the center of the temple... Admittedly, this team gave it a great effort and just ended up coming up short. It would have helped greatly if they'd tried progressing downward from the Shrine rather than using the elevator in the Lightning Ball Room to progress downward. However, this is one of two episodes in which a player progresses downward from that room, the other being the Shriveled Hand of Efoua (2-3).");
