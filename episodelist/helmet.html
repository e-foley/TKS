First of all, instead of climbing directly through the Cave of Sighs when her partner was caught, she went to the Room of the Three Gargoyles and then traversed downwards. Secondly, she found the key in the Tomb of Ancient Kings but did not use it to go up--instead she busted through the wall and rose ever so slowly to the second floor. Not a single team ever retrieved the artifact successfully from the center of the temple in Season 1, and it was because the players always acted like the ones in this episode.", "Der Kommissar", "The frontrunner in this temple run was VERY fast and smart - too bad he got taken out in the Harmonic Convergence room early in the run. The second runner was NOT the same. She wasn't nearly as fast, and didn't try using the key in the Tomb (which she DID find) to ascend to the Shrine. Instead, she plowed through to the Well, and used the ever-so-slow elevator. Too bad.");
