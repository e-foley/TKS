I truly thought that this temple run was going to be a great one. Through the temple games, the Iguanas continued to show great effort to win. In the run, the frontrunnner, Michael, made superb time when he was removed in the Room of the Secret Password. His partner, Kelly... Was the worst planner I've ever seen in the temple. Instead of the logical conclusion of following her partner's route, she went up into the King's Storeroom where she had to complete the objective to pass into the Room of the Ancient Warriors. After delaying a lot through the already completed rooms, she took an even longer time in the Room of the Secret Password, where she laid out all the passwords at the front of the room as she said them. She made it into the Quicksand Bog, but considering she had a full eighty seconds to herself and a cleared-out path, she should have been the one to bring the Gavel out of the temple.<p align=left>On a different note, the temple game sequence in this episode was one of the most unusual the show had. The first game was the "go-through-each-of-the-chambers-carrying-a-rope-and-escape-and-pull-the-rope-through" game. The second was the rocking horse game where "unconscious travelers" were attatched onto each of the players, and the third game was a two player "roll in the circular drum game" which was the only non-timed temple game in the third season.

<p align=left><font color="darkgreen"><b>Summary below by Der Kommissar:</b></font><p align=left>

One wrong turn spelled disaster for the team in this run. The frontrunner assembled the statue in the Shrine, and although the Bog door opened, he instead progressed to the Secret Password room, where he was removed from the temple. His partner was slow-witted, and went to the King's Storeroom where she met a Temple Guard and was forced to complete the objective. She also tried completing the objective in the Room of the Ancient Warriors - even though her partner had already done so. She also neglected to take the Shrine-Bog path. Time ran out just as she had entered the Quicksand Bog via the Pharaoh's Secret Passage. Had the frontrunner gone straight down to the Bog, chances are this would have been a victory. Side note: An extremely rare example of an episode in which the Tomb of Headless Kings does not have a Temple Guard, nor does it have the artifact.<p align=left><font color="darkblue"><b>Michael Hackney's Opinion:</b></font><p align=left>
Kelly may have been a poor planner, but if there were a poll for cutest girl contestant in the show's history, she would've had my vote by miles. No, make that light years. Wonder what she (as well as the others) look like (and do for a living) now? Still, Kelly did make a big error in not taking the path already cleared. Another big error she made was not removing her mouthpiece in the Room of the Secret Password. She sounded like she'd gotten too much novocain at the dentist trying to read those passwords. She was still cute as a button, though.
