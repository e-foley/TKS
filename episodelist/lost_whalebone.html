One thing to notice about this episode is how impatient Kirk is when Damien is running through the temple.", "Der Kommissar", "Basically, this was like every other temple run that had a treasure at the center of the temple - a tragedy. The players weren't too fast, and this cost them dearly - the second runner ran out of time in the Room of the Ancient Warriors - just one room from the Chamber.","Aaron F.","The frontrunner went at a very slow pace but did manage to make it to the Shrine where she was taken out. Then it was time for her partner to go in. It took him only 30 seconds to get to where his partner left off, but by the time he was pulling down the armors in the Ancient Warriors room time ran out. By looking at the diagram you could tell that the crew was being hard on the players--too bad! Side notes: Trip to Mexico City. Fogg Quote: \"You cant slow down or the temple will get you.\"");
