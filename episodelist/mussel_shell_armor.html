One day he and his wife were approached by a band of neighboring warriors. They accused Apanuugpak of fishing in their territory. A circle of enemy warriors tightened around Apanuugpak but he was unafraid. They shot arrows at him, which struck him but he just laughed. Astonished, the men turned and ran. Apanuugpak's wife was worried about him, but he showed her the Mussel Shell Armor he invented. The Mussel-Shell Armor could be found in The Chamber of the Sacred Markers.";

The frontrunner, Amanda, started off rather slowly, but without backtracking, made it to the Dark Forest before her removal. Few words could describe Gator's speed... I'd have to say that he would have been better named \"Cheetah\" than \"Gator.\" He BLAZED through the rooms at a speed faster than the cameraman could keep up with, bashed through the wall, assembled the monkey, chose the correct armor, and then grabbed the artifact, all without a nanosecond of hesitation. After grabbing the armor, he made it out of the temple in so little time it must have been a record. A healthy ten seconds were still left on the clock when he crossed the gate. The team's trip to Jamaica was very well-earned.", "Der Kommissar", "Season Three had a lot of artifacts hidden at the center of the temple, and every time one was hidden there, the team lost - with the exception of this episode. These were two VERY smart players, and it showed. Amanda raced into the temple, and was removed a minute and thirty seconds into the run by a temple spirit in the Dark Forest. Gator (that's his name, believe it or not) retraced his predecessor's footsteps, smashed the wall, entered the top floor via the Quicksand Bog ladder to the Shrine, worked his way over to the Chamber, got the armor, and got out with about ten seconds to spare! Only two episodes in the show's history ever saw a team successfully retrieve an artifact from the center of the temple, and this is one of them.");
