He started off through the Cave of Sighs and went up to the Observatory from the Wall Climb, where he was caught by his only temple guard. He then went into the Treasure room, where he promptly climbed down through it and into the Swamp. (This is one of the only, if not the only, episodes where a player climbs downwards from that room.) From here, he followed the bottom route to the Dungeon, where he climbed up to the Pirate's Cove and grabbed the moccasins. His partner needed only to watch him bring the artifact out with more than a minute to spare. Notice that the frontrunner switched floors three times on his path to the artifact, which is pretty impressive for a solo run.","Der Kommissar","It's hard to name an absolute best temple run of all time, but this is a very likely candidate for that title. The frontrunner was extremely fast, and switched floors several times during the temple run. With all the floor switching and rooms he covered, you'd think this temple run would have been a very close finish, but the opposite couldn't be more true - he escaped from the temple with over a minute to spare! Temple Runs don't get any more spectacular. On a side note, this is the only episode in which a player uses the treasure chest in the Treasure Room to progress downward. Also, during Olmec's temple summary, you can clearly see the Temple Guard in the Observatory.");
