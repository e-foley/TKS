She passed through the rooms with ease until her removal in the Dark Forest (by the stage-RIGHT tree, which usually did not have a guard). Matthew followed his partner's exact footsteps, which unfortunately included an unneccessary visit to the King's Storeroom. By the time he reached the Quicksand Bog, time was running quite short, yet he neglected trying the Shrine ladder's actuator (which most probably would have opened the door). Time ran out at the precise second he shouted out \"open sesame,\" but as Kirk included, \"he still had a monkey to put together.\" These were good players, but a difficult temple design and uneccessarily entering rooms hurt them.", "Der Kommissar", "These players were actually quite fast and intelligent, but two critical errors cost them their victory. The frontrunner failed to notice that the door from the Pit to the Chamber had opened, and was forced to unnecessarily visit the King's Storeroom. After climbing down the center shaft and traversing left, she was removed from the temple in the Dark Forest. The second runner retraced her steps - making the same error she did. Likewise, he made the second big mistake - at the Bog, he didn't try the ladder. Time ran out when he was reading passwords. Had the team not made these two mistakes, they probably would have gotten to the Bag.");
