Leif knew that his ship had been knocked off course for days, that he was lost, and that his father Eric the Red would be worried about him. A sudden lightning strike lit up the sky and Erikson was able to spot a piece of land to the West. The next day, the storm had dissipated, and the crew had safely landed in modern day America. Erikson and the crew left a stone marker at their settlement in hopes of returning with other Vikings, but never did. The Stone Marker could be found in the Tomb of the Ancient Kings. ";

The doors to the Tomb of Ancient Kings from the Bamboo Forest did not work, so the frontrunner tried the doors to go up, but none opened. After spending a full minute in that room, she retreated back to the Room of Harmonic Convergence, where she went up to the Heart Room. She wasn't even allowed access to the Treasure Room from there, so she was forced to go up once more into the Observatory. She was then caught by a second temple guard. The second player went as far as he could, but did not nearly have enough time to make any progress. Note: This temple design was an exact copy of \"The Paintbrush of Leonardo Da Vinci\" found in Season 1, Layout 5.","Der Kommissar","This temple run featured a downright brutal layout. The frontrunner raced straight along the bottom floor of the temple into the Bamboo Forest - and the room contained both a Temple Guard and a dead end. Because of this, it took her over a minute just to get out of that room! After correcting her dead end turn and progressing up to the Heart Room, she wasn't even allowed access to the Treasure Room! She was removed from the temple in the Observatory. The second runner wasn't able to make any additional progress before time expired. As a final note, this was the only episode to feature a Temple Guard in the Bamboo Forest.","Mike Lowrey","It's understandable why this team didn't make it to the artifact. The layout design was just terrible. The frontrunner made excellent time as he sped through the bottom floor of the temple. Once she entered the Bamboo Forest (and met a temple guard), she tried the door to the Tomb of Ancient Kings but that was obviously locked. She tried the doors that led up into the Treasure Room but no such luck. She spent well over a minute before she went back into the Room of Harmonic Convergence and went up into the Heart Room. Right here it shows how much the producers expected of these kids. After trying the actuator leading to the Treasure Room, the door remained locked, so she went up into the Observatory, where she was taken out. The second runner didn't have time to make additional progress. He did all he could before time expired.");
