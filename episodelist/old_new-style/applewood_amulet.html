Zapata then made an amulet out of one the tree's branches. The amulet was for Zapata's father, and he would not put it down until all of Mexico is free. Then, all the people of Mexico helped Zapata build a new Mexican republic. When Zapata died, the amulet vanished. The Amulet could be found in The Viper's Nest.";

It takes a while for her to find the Amulet, but once she does, she blazes back. With the seconds ticking down, she drops into the Pit, and then climbs into the Ledges with ten seconds remaining. Once she finally climbs through them, four seconds remain, and she desperately dashes towards the temple gate. The camera switches to a wide-angle view, and just as the final second comes, a jumping body emerges from the temple entrance and lands on the ground, recording the closest victory in the show's history. The team passed up an obvious half pendant at the entrance to Medusa's Lair, but it made no difference. This is, in my opinion, one of the best episodes ever produced, even if the temple design was much simpler than usual. Olivia-Emma had had her practice on a game show already; she was also on the Nick game show <i>Get the Picture</i> before her appearance on <i>Legends</i>.","Der Kommissar","This is one of those \"one second left\" victories that you can't help but love. Admittedly, the temple design here was much more simplistic than in some other episodes, but the team put forth a good effort, and they deserved to win.","Kirk Fogg's Commentary of the Final Ten Seconds and the Victory Celebration","\"Oh my! It's coming down to the last seconds! Up the slide--four, three, TWO, ONE... SHE MADE IT! She made it! Can you believe it!? She made it! She got it all! <i>(off microphone)</i> Unbelievable! They got it all! <i>(returning to microphone)</i> She made it! They got it all, folks--the boombox, the encyclopedia, US Space Camp... We gotta get outta here--I don't want to, but we do... See ya next time for another great Legend of the Hidden Temple! Buh-bye!\"");
