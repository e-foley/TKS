After telling the story of Nathan Hale and his Secret Battle plan, Olmec announced that the artifact was hidden in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, but it did not appear to be there when they showed the room. Strangely, during the temple games, the Secret Plan can be easily seen on top of the Throne of the Pretender. The Throne Room was accompanied by the Swamp and the Heart Room, indicating that the episode was Layout 1. However, after the Silver Snakes proved themselves worthy and Olmec was describing the temple, we see The Pit, the Laser Light Room, the Jester's Court, the Room of the Secret Password and the Room of the Mandarin Hand, indicating that it was suddenly Layout 5. How and why did that happen?! Anyway, the temple run was extremely quick. Although the frontrunner found the half pendant at the door of the Observatory and pointed it out, the second player went past it, went back for it, and couldn't find it. The team found their third and final temple guard in the King's Storeroom, with well over one minute to go.");
