Tough moat, very challenging.

Nothing really to say, actually. However, Jeremy did cheat in the first game by going through the shortcut, instead of going through the proper area.

In my opinion, this was one of the best episodes ever made. The temple run was not only one of the quickest in the history of the show, but the team effort of the Silver Snakes could not have been surpassed in value. The frontrunner got taken out in less than thirty seconds by a temple guard in the Tomb of the Headless Kings, but the second contestant blazed through the bottom floor, climbed up the Secret Passage, and got the artifact with 1:38 to go. Exiting the temple, he stayed on the top path all the way, and finished the temple run for the team in under two minutes! What I also like about this episode is the amount of character shown in Kirk Fogg. Usually, he just says the same things each and every episode, showing little emotion, but here his personality shined through with excellent results. Side note: This is the only team completion with more than a minute to go.

The third season had its share of horrible and excellent episodes alike, and this was one of the excellent ones. This wasn't only one of the best temple runs of the third season, but also of the entire series. The frontrunner was removed from the temple just half a minute into the run. The second runner was even faster than the first, and managed to get the Earring and get out in under two minutes! Not many Temple Runs feature a player getting an artifact out of the Temple in under two minutes - and this is one of the few.

Kevin was so quick, even the jib camera operator had trouble keeping up. If Nick had used a SteadiCam on the show (which they should have, as that would've done the series' speed justice), and placed it in the Room of the Ancient Warriors, instead of what looked like a home movie camera, Kevin's momentum might've caused him to run down both the SteadiCam operator, and his cordholder! That, of course, would be due to the fact that there was so little room in that room (no pun intended) between the suits of armor, and the front of the room itself.
