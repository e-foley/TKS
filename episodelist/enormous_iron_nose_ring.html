Before the run, he told Kirk, \"I think I can handle it.\" He sure did, getting the artifact with 1:34 left and exiting with 0:57 to spare. What makes this run even more incredible is that Joel was not caught by a single temple guard on the entire run. This episode leaves me pretty much speechless.", "Der Kommissar", "This is arguably the best solo temple run of all time. Joel made it across the bottom floor of the temple in under a minute. Not long after, he got the Nose Ring and escaped the temple in just 2:03. Side Note: In the Dark Forest you can see a tree's arms move just after Joel breaks through the wall - proof that there was a Temple Guard there that didn't get him.", "Michael Hackney", "Joel did what other contestants did, which cost them victory--when he got to the very top room in the Temple The Observatory, he went all the way down to The Laser Light Room. Thankfully, he had enough time to get out without looking like a doofus. However, Joel had grabbed the object with 1:34 left on the clock. Had he not gone down, he'd have shattered, and put away for good, the record for the fastest (completed) Temple Run of them all. The old record was from season one's \"Mask of Shaka Zulu\" episode, completed in 1:46. Of course, the contestant there had two things going for him--he only needed to go through four rooms on the Temple's bottom level to get to the mask, and there were two entrances to the Temple, one to the top level, and one to the bottom level through the Cave of Size (plus, he met up with one Temple Guard). In Joel's episode, the entrance to the bottom level was closed off...and he saw no Guards.");
