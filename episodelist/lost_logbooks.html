If they had won just one more half pendant, the team could have easily made it to the Logbooks.", "Der Kommissar", "No Legends contestant ever successfully retrieved an artifact from the Dungeon - or ever even REACHED the artifact hidden there - but this team came the closest. Unfortunately, early in the run, the frontrunner accidentally detoured into the Harmonic Convergence room, where he met a Temple Guard. The second runner was taken out of the temple in the Pirates Cove, just one room away from the artifact. If the team hadn't taken that bad detour, or if they'd had two pendants, they could easily have reached the artifact. On a side note, this is the only Temple Run of the first season to feature a guard in the top left room of the temple (in this case, it's the Pirates' Cove.)");
