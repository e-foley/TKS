There she married a Cherokee named Sam Starr, and their home became a hideout for many outlaws, including Jesse James. Jesse had buried his stash of stolen gold somewhere near the Starr's cabin, but forgot where he hid the map to where it was buried. He offered half of the gold to Belle in exchange for helping him find the map. Just then, a group of Jesse's enemies were heard approaching, so Jesse fled to keep them from finding the gold. Belle found the map, but didn't want to dig up the gold until Jesse returned, which he never did. The Secret Map could be found in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.";

The Jaguars won the final temple game, forcing a tiebreaker round after their opponents had won the previous two. The Silver Snakes redeemed themselves and answered correctly, winning themselves a trip to the temple, but their chances would be slim to win--they had only one pendant. During the run, the frontrunner, Miriam started off at a good speed through the rooms, but got caught in the Tomb. Inside the Jesters' Court, she wasted some time by receding back into the Tomb of the Headless Kings after her already-too-long struggle completing the objective. She was taken out in the Forest with little more than a minute remaining, when Zach raced into the temple. I mean raced! He flew through the temple to the point of his partner's departure, and then broke through the wall, climbed the slide, grabbed the Map, and raced back to the gate with nine seconds to spare. They earned themselves a trip to Santa Monica. We owe our memories of the show to temple runs like these.","Der Kommissar","This is a very exciting (and successful) run. Miriam raced across the bottom floor of the temple but was taken out in the Dark Forest. Zac made up for the lost time, though. He grabbed the Map from the Shrine and escaped the temple in 2:51. Side Note: In most of the Season Three \"Olmec's advice\" scenes, you can see the map in the Shrine.","Michael Hackney","With what was on the line, and knowing how little they had as far as pendants are concerned (then again, possessing one pendant was as low as it got), there was no doubt that this was the best temple run of the final season. Zach knew he had to clean up after Miriam was taken out, and he did beautifully. His jump into the Pit was very well done--his torso was straight up the whole time. He did the best wall-busting I ever saw on the show, and my favorite part was when he looked back at the camera while starting to climb up the Pharaoh's Secret Passage, almost as if to say humbly, \"Watch this!\"");
