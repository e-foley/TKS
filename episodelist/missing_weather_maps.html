He took off and flew for 33 1/2 hours to Paris. While flying, he fell asleep at the controls and when he woke up, he drifted off course. Heavy sheets of ice formed on the wings, which could've snapped off and made him crash. Luckily, the wings held. When he arrived in Paris, Lindbergh became famous. He donated his plane to the Smithsonian Museum, but the weather maps were lost in Paris. The Missing Weather Maps could be found in The Dark Forest.";

The front runner absolutely blazed through the temple, and could have easily had a record if he was not caught by two temple guards so early. The contestant who took over was rather slow, and took many wrong turns. Unfortunately, this lagging cost the team their vacation.","Der Kommissar","You know those temple runs where a tactical genius is forced to join up with a slow-witted player? This was one of those runs. The frontrunner was extremely fast but had terrible luck, being removed from the temple early on in the run. The second runner wasted a lot of time and took horribly inefficient turns. She progressed downward from the Shrine to the Dark Forest in the last few seconds of the run, but couldn't quite get the Maps in time. Although this end result was very disappointing, this is a closest a player ever came to reaching the artifact in the Dark Forest.","Doug E. Fresh","I hate this run; I really, really hate it. The maps were in the Dark Forest, one of my favorite rooms, and this layout was pretty easy. The frontrunner Nick was quick, but unfortunately he was taken out in the King&#146;s Storeroom. Then we get introduced to one of the most clueless players in Legends history: Kim (why is it that all the Kim&#146;s and Kimberly&#146;s on the show are dumb and clueless? We got Kim from John Henry&#146;s Lost Hammer and we got Kimberly from The Broken Trident of Poseidon). She got to the King&#146;s Storeroom in decent speed, but then it went downhill from there. After slowly completing the objective, Kim went into the OBSERVATORY instead of the Shrine (she corrected her mistake though). Once the Shrine was completed, she went into the ROOM OF THE SECRET PASSWORD instead of the open Dark Forest. She realized her mistake, but it was too late.<p/>I really hate this run because it was the closest anyone came to grabbing the item in the Dark Forest, and it should've been grabbed! Normally when an item is in the Dark Forest, the layout is tough and both players on the team are good (example: The Useless Map of the Chibcha Chieftain). Also, when the item is in this room and the layout is easy, there&#146;s at least one player that sucks badly (another example: The Mysterious Manuscript of Mary Shelley). Again, I really hate this run and I hate Kim for being so slow-witted.");
