After defeating the entire world, Alexander declared himself a god. Disappointed since there was nothing left to conquer, Alexander went to bed and died.

Although it is difficult to tell from watching the show, the second player picks up a second half of a pendant on the Monkey's base in the Shrine.","Der Kommissar", "This temple run featured players of average skill. They probably could have had a victory, but luck was against them. They tried accessing the Treasure Room via the ladder in the Holes of Python, but it didn't open. After that, they continued onward across the bottom floor, and took the extremely slow elevator up. The door failing to open upward to the treasure room must have discouraged them from trying to try doors leading toward the artifact. Because of this, time ran out.");
