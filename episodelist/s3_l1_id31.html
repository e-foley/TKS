This run featured Eddie and Tess, who were two pretty average players. Besides his initial decision to enter the Crypt, Eddie had no choice of which doors he wanted to enter. The Crypt lead to the Pit, the Pit lead to the Chamber, and then finally to the Room of the Ancient Warriors, where he was taken out with 1:47 to go. Tess followed his footprints to the ancient warriors, where she wasted a bit of time realizing that the door had already been opened. She went into the Shrine, slowly constucted the monkey, and took the ladder to the Forest. Unfortunately, here she became lost. She took forever trying to think of what to do, and was only more confused by the temple spirit that caught her. In the last seconds of the run, she found the key, but she couldn't open the door to the Court quickly enough to get the Corn. 

<p align=left><font color="darkgreen"><b>Summary below by Der Kommissar:</b></font><p align=left>

If the players in this run hadn't gotten so distracted by the Temple Guards that they encountered, there's a very good chance that they could have gotten to the artifact. Kirk referred to the first runner as Fast Eddie, and he was fast - until a guard in the Chamber distracted him from completing the objective. In the Room of the Ancient Warriors, he was removed from the temple entirely. Tess came into the temple, and had many of the same problems that other Legends players have had, and this would ultimately end up costing the team their chances of getting to the artifact. In the Warrior room, she tried using a suit of armor even though the Shrine was open. Likewise, in the Shrine, she tried assembling the monkey incorrectly - a mistake that happens too often. After encountering a Temple Spirit in the Dark Forest, she was distracted horribly from completing the goal. Her sense of direction in the temple was obviously very bad, as she tried sticking the key everywhere before finally opening the door to the Jesters Court. She raced into the Court and grabbed the Corn, but by the time she laid her hands on it, time had expired.
