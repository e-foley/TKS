The king had so many war elephants that their footprints still exist at the gates of the ancient city. His war elephants wore gold on their tusks, and he wore very lavish garments and jewelry. In the early 1100's, Suryavarman began construction of Angkor Wat, which is still the largest religious monument in the world. Suryavarman placed a statue of Shiva built with ivory arms in Angkor Wat. After the fall of the Cambodian empire, looters stole the arms from the statue. The Stolen Arm could be found in the Bamboo Forest.";

In the final game, the members of both teams had to alternate placing golden covers on 4 \"elephant tusks\" that were elevated off the floor.<br><br><b>Bob's Note:</b> I'm surprised that the judges didn't notice that Evan got his bells out of sequence in the first game. He was supposed to go to the top, then get the bells as he came down. Instead, he got the right side bells as he went up, grabbed the one on top, then the left side ones as he climbed down. This would've proven interesting if Joseph didn't beat him anyway.";

By watching the run, you could definitely tell that Kirk felt the same way. The team ran out of time in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, two rooms away from the artifact. Note that the player picked up a second half-pendant of life in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, but it was completely unannounced by Kirk Fogg. (Thanks to \"The Ancient Warrior\" for this information.)","Der Kommissar","Here's one of those temple runs where taking the path directly to the artifact fails, and it costs the team dearly. The first runner encountered a Temple Guard at the Cave Of Sighs, but continued over to the [Room of Harmonic Convergence] and up to the Observatory, where a second guard took her out. Her partner followed her footsteps, but wasted too much time in the Treasure Room. His time ran out in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, as he was putting the statue together. Side Notes: This episode marks the only time an artifact is ever hidden in the Bamboo Forest. It's also interesting to note that the episode only gets the room's name right ONCE in the entire episode (Olmec's summary of the temple.) The room is referred to as the Bamboo Swamp when Olmec says where the artifact his hidden, and as the Swamp by Kirk. Also, the arm is on the ledge at the front of the room when its location is revealed prior to the Steps of Knowledge, but it is tangled in the mass of bamboo strands during the temple run.");
