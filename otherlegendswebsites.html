<!---<a href="http://www.shrineofthesilvermonkey.com">The Shrine of the Silver Monkey</a></td><td class="desc">
A large <i>Legends</i> resource that made its claim to fame by offering exclusive content--while it is no longer updated frequently, it still offers pictures, interviews, and downloads you wouldn't find anywhere else. Plus, it provides a wealth of information to make any <i>Legends</i> fan happy.</td></tr><tr><td class="linkcell">-->

<a href="
http://www.freewebs.com/thesecretpassword/index.htm">The Room of the Secret Password</a></td><td class="desccell">
On this new website, you can find a variety of <i>Legends</i> resources, such as an episode guide, polls, and more. It's still growing, but it's worth a visit.</td></tr><tr><td class="linkcell">

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_the_Hidden_Temple">Wikipedia Entry</a></td><td class="desccell">An online encyclopedia entry dealing with everything about the show. It explains the show's format much better than mine, and has some trivia you may have missed when viewing this site. If you find something you'd like to add, edit the page via the link at the top. Absolutely everybody has this privilege.</td></tr>

<a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/olmec.html">
Olmec Website</a>
</td><td class="desccell">
Ever wondered how Olmec got his name? While not about the game show, this huge web page talks all about the ancient Olmec civilization, and goes into detail about the enormous stone heads which they are famous for. This is a must-see for Legends fans!</td></tr><tr><td class="linkcell">

<a href="http://www.deebaker.com/">
Dee Baker's Website</a>
</td><td class="desccell">
The voice of Olmec and the prize announcer were both provided by Dee Bradley Baker. This is his website; it lists shows he has worked on, and provides amazing vocal samples!</td></tr><tr><td class="linkcell">

Universal Studios Orlando</a>
</td><td class="desccell">
This site is Universal Studios Orlando's homepage. Included on it are facts about the soundstages themselves, including those where <i>Legends</i> and other Nick game shows were produced. Look for Stage 18 (<i>Legends</i>) and Stage 21 (<i>GUTS</i>).</td></tr>

If you would like to submit a site, or you know of a site that I have left out, please contact me <a href="http://nicklegends.elfractal.com/contacts.html">here</a>. It's important to me that a new site has gained enough exposure to warrant my support of it here, so do not expect brand-new websites to be added immediately. Furthermore, sites with largely unoriginal content will unlikely be listed.<p align=center>
