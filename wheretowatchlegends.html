Beginning on May 14, 2007, <i>Legends</i> began showing reruns on Nickelodeon for the first time since its scattered repeats in the nineties. Everybody with a basic cable program should be able to get the channel. Currently, <i>Legends</i> shows at 7:30AM every weekday morning for those in the Pacific and Eastern time zones, 6:30AM for those in the Central time zone, and at various other times for the remainder of the country. (If any Alaska, Hawaii, or Mountain Time Zone residents would like to tell me when it airs in your area, please do.) <i>Legends</i> originally aired on Nickelodeon between 1993 and 1995. Considering the show is aged by Nickelodeon's standards, this is very likely a temporary appearance.

Nick GAS is a network that specializes in older Nickelodeon programming, primarily game shows. As <i>Legends of the Hidden Temple</i> is currently one of  their most popular shows, you you can expect it to be on quite often. (Hopefully, 14 times a day is enough for everyone.) Unfortunately, this channel is only available through digital cable or from a satellite dish. Dish Network currently offers Nick GaS on channel 177; however, the digital cable channel will vary from region to region. To my knowledge, the network is currently not featured by DirecTV, but I will try to update you as the situation changes.

<li>The episodes that begin on the hour are the same episodes throughout the day, as are the episodes that begin on the half-hour. In other words, there are two different episodes per day.
<li>Add an appropriate number of hours to adjust the times for your time zone.

TurboNick, accessible at <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/turbonick"><font color="black">http://www.nick.com/all_nick/turbonick</font></a>, has shown a number of <i>Legends</i> episodes under its "Nick Rewind" section in the past, available to watch for free. If the episodes ever return, this would the perfect solution if you haven't seen <i>Legends</i> in a very long time and want to see it again without paying extra for an expanded TV channel selection.<p align=left>-->

<font size=4>Homemade Tapes</font></a><p align=left><font size=3>

While the process is not technically legal, there are a number of websites online that allow you to receive taped episodes of the show in trade for your own tapes. I'd rather not list the websites here, but a quick Google search will help you on your way.


<!---<i>Legends</i> episodes can still be seen if you have digital cable, on the channel <a href="http://www.nick.com/gas"><font color=black>Nickelodeon GAS</font></a>. If you want to see its current TV schedule, click <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/gas/watch/tv_schedule/tvsched_body_est.jhtml"><font color=black>here</font></a>. (All times are EST, and each day of the week reads from left to right.) To my knowlege, it is not yet on DirecTV, but we'll see what happens, and I update you is the situation changes.---><p align=center>
