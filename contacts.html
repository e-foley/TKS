<!--
Companies send spy-bots to search for complete e-mail addresses put on websites, so the addresses have been written irregularly to discourage such activity. The webmasters check their e-mails regularly, so you should receive a prompt reply. Don't be afraid to comment on or ask questions about the show or the site, as they'd be more than happy to answer them for you. They don't bite, and even they did, they couldn't bite you over e-mail. ;-)<p align=center>

Alternatively, you can try the <a href="http://nicklegends.elfractal.com/contacts/form1.html"><font color="black">feedback form</font></a> that allows you to rate the individual sections of the site and leave feedback for Ed; however, he will <b>not</b> reply to any messages left in this manner. (Feel free to use both methods.)<p align=left>-->
