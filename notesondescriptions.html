Notes on Descriptions</font><p><font size=3>
I try to keep a very consistent system for keeping notes on shows. Below is a list of the standardization system I use. This page was last updated 6/16/06.</font></b><p align=left>

<table><tr><td><font size=3 face="arial"><b>Diagram Key</b><br>
1. The gray diagram is meant to represent the temple's structure, where each gray area surrounded by a black box is a room.<br>
2. On the temple diagrams, the pink line traces the path of the contestants through the temple, and ends if the player has reached the artifact, has been removed from the temple by a temple guard, or has run out of time.<br>
3. A blue square placed in a room symbolizes that a temple guard or temple spirit emerged from that room to capture a player, and did so.<br>
4. The yellow circle represents the room the artifact was hidden in.<br>
5. If the team recovers the second half of their pendant, the place they found it is represented by a green X.<br>
6. Any miscellaneous occurrences that I choose to include in a second temple diagram are indicated by an orange line.</td><td><img src="images/allin12.gif"></td></table><p align=left>

<b>Path Tracing Restrictions</b><br>
1. The pink line shows both players' progress, not just the first or second.<br>
2. The intent of the pink line is not to show where the players went in each room, rather to show simply which rooms they entered.<br>
3. The narrow rectangular room on the left of the diagram is only used if a team uses the Pharaoh's Secret Passage during the third season.<br>
4. The intersection point between floor boundaries is drawn in comparison with the room. Many diagrams that do not follow this rule are currently being raplaced.<br>
5. If a player is captured by a temple guard in a room that the guard did not originally emerge from, the additional progress that player made after passing through the guarded room is still represented.<br>
6. If time runs out while a player is going through a door, the pink line is drawn so that it meets the black boundary line.<br>
7. If a player enters the room where the artifact is hidden, yet does not make contact with it, the pink line is drawn to show how close the contestant came.

<b>Other Episode Notes</b><br>
1. The naming source I use for the indexing of my episodes comes from the artifact's name as Olmec says it at the start of the show, except in special cases where Kirk corrects Olmec's announcement of the artifact.<br>
2. Any extra things Olmec says while announcing the day's legend are included in parentheses after the artifact name.<br>
3. If Olmec never announces the artifact's name at the start of the show, the name of the episode in the Episode List defaults to what Olmec <i>did</i> say. The name of the artifact within an episode description, however, uses the announcement of the artifact prior to the Steps of Knowledge.<br>
4. When a team completes the temple in under three minutes, the time remaining on the clock is taken when the team player crosses the temple gate with the artifact.<br>
5. If the team is caught by a third temple guard without a pendant, the time remaining is taken when the temple guard makes contact with the player upon capture.<br> 
6. If the temple guard never does make contact with the player, the time remaining is taken when the temple guard could have done so if the player remained in that room.<p align=left>

<b>Summary Guidelines</b><br>
1. Summaries submitted to the site of significant depth, length, or insight from other individuals will be in a paragraph included under my description of the episode, labeled with identification that individualizes the contributer.<br>
2. This identification need not be the contributer's real name, and may be an alias or a nickname if it is desired.
