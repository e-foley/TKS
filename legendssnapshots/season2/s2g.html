In this temple game, players had to grab an object in the central basket, then stretch out to stick it on one of the corner pillars. The bungee cord combined with the suds made this a difficult game to play.<p align=left>

This temple game seemed to be featured in more Season 1 episodes than any other. Players here would usually need to grab an object from the bottom of the slippery ramp, then, on their knees, ascend the ramp and place their object at the top before sliding down. This would be repeated as many times as necessary. Sometimes the players needed to do the inverse (i.e. grab an object at the top and slide down) instead.<p align=left>

While many variations on this game were made, it required players to ascend a mountain as quickly as possible, aided with ropes or placable pegs. Often, this temple game was shown in a split-screen style.<p align=left>

Possibly the lowest-budget temple game featured on the show, this game required players to transfer cloth material completely from one partner to the other and back. The game rarely took the alotted 60 seconds to complete.<p align=left>

This was another temple game that was featured very often in the first season. Players here would need to excavate in the packing popcorn material below them in search for an object, which they would then climb with to the top of the shaft before depositing it in whichever way required to score.<p align=left>

This particular temple game was rerely played in the same fashion, however, players always needed to slide down a slimy chute. Usually, this game was played with collectible objects, while other times, players just needed to slide as far as possible.<p align=left>

This game was played on a similar, though not identical ramp as the temple game earlier in this list. Because of the increased difficulty with the flowing water and a steeper slope, players usually needed only to push an object up to the top and slide back down.<p align=left>

This temple game was a simple transfer game. Players would climb themselves to the center of the familiar sudsy blue tarp where they would exchange an object in whatever way needed. This game was occasionally played with velcro helmets to easy the transfer.<p align=left>

In this temple game, the team players would need to alternate jumping from the ground in order to either place an object at the top of the pillar or take an object down from it. This game was rarely fun to watch because at least one team never seemed to be able to play it correctly. It produced some very anti-climactic lop-sided games.<p align=left>

Another game with many variations. Here, players would need to slide through the dragon-themed wavy tunnel from one side to the other to transfer an object as necessary. Sometimes the tunnel was filled with foam rocks to excavate on their way.<p align=left>

Players in this game would usually need to take an object placed at the base of the wall and bring it up to stick on the green velcro. Sometimes also, the velcro would be placed in patches on either side of the partition in the center. This game was played in more ways then any other temple game I can name.<p align=left>

I cannot give many details on this game because it was not featured often. In this particular picture, teams are trying to thread a needle placed at the top of the tower with rope. This specific temple game was one of the most confusing of all in the first season.<p align=left>

The simplest temple game of all. One teammate would need to throw velcro balls onto his or her partner's velcro clothing. The team with the most balls stuck to their velcro would win the game.<p align=left>
