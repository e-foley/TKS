<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The Pit</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
The Pit was a very simple room. There were two platforms on either side of the room, with a rope hanging from the ceiling in the center.

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The Observatory</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
<font color=darkred>The Room of the Mandarin Hand</b></font></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
In the Room of the Mandarin Hand, a giant hand holding a ball was placed at the center of the room.

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The King's Storeroom</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The Room of the Secret Password</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
If the player entered from the Mine Shaft, he or she would need to open the panels placed on the outer walls, and read the "inscription" on the tablet. If it was the correct passage, then the door to the right could open. If the player entered from the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, he or she would only need to ride the elevator downwards into the Mine Shaft.</td><td><img src="http://nicklegends.elfractal.com/images/templediagram_h7.gif"></td></tr></table><p align=center>

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The Mine Shaft</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
If the player rode the elevator down to the room, they could take the ladder up to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, or bash through the wall and head to the Dark Forest. If they entered from the Dark Forest, they could ride the elevator up to the Room of the Secret Password, if it was available.</td><td><img src="http://nicklegends.elfractal.com/images/templediagram_h8.gif"></td></tr></table><p align=center>

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The Dark Forest</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
This room featured two large trees with holes in their trunks. The player that entered this room would look for a key in the holes of the trees. If they were unsuccessful, they could bash the wall and enter the Mine Shaft.</td><td><img src="http://nicklegends.elfractal.com/images/templediagram_h9.gif"></td></tr></table><p align=center>

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
The Jester's Court</b></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
In the Jester's Court, players needed to align themselves with three wall paintings, while pressing three actuators.

<table width=65%><tr><td colspan=2><b>
