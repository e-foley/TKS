<font color=darkred>The Rock Quarry / The Troubled Bridge</b></font></td></tr><tr><td width=65%>
This room was divided into two halves. When the player entered from either the Crypt or the Observatory he or she would only need to hit an actuator at the opposite side of the bridge to open the door. If the player entered from the Ledges, he or she would need to put five rocks into a large bucket to lift the stone slab covering the door to the Laser Light Room. NOTE: Coincidentally, the bucket was the same used as the elevator in layouts 6 - 9 of Season 1.</td><td><img src="http://nicklegends.elfractal.com/images/templediagram_h2.gif"></td></tr></table><p align=center>
