Name all of the Season 2, Layout 1 episodes.<p align=left>

The correct answers are:<br>
The Golden Stallion of Ali Baba, The Silver Cannonball of Grandy Nanny, and The Silver Horseshoe of Butch Cassidy.<p align=left>

Notice how two of the episodes included "silver," and one included "gold." Nothing important, but it is interesting...<p align=left>

<b>Question 6:<br></b>
Only two treasures were ever hidden in this room, but they were both retrieved from the temple successfully. Name this room.<p align=left>

The correct answer is:<br>
The Pirates' Cove<p align=left>

The correct answer is:<br>
The Treasure Room<p align=left>

The Treasure Room was changed into the Treasury of Golden Orbs between layouts 8 and 9 of Season 1. Because the objective now included putting the orb in the correct pedestal, the actuators were not needed.<p align=left>

<b>Question 8:<br></b>
Name the only room of the temple that featured a temple guard in every episode but one it was featured in.
<p align=left>

<b>Question 9:<br></b>
How many exits were there from the Holes Of Python?<p align=left>

The correct answer is:<br>

<b>Question 10:<br></b>
The rock bucket used in the Rock Quarry also had another use in its past. What was it?<p align=left>

The correct answer is:<br>
It was used as the bucket for the Well in Season 1.<p align=left>

<b>Question 11:<br></b>

The rooms featured in this location were the Throne Room, the Room of Harmonic Convergence, The Laser Light Room, and the Tomb of the Headless Kings.<p align=left>

The correct answers are:<br>
The Dungeon and the Quicksand Bog<p align=left>

<b>Question 15:<br></b>
Two rooms appeared in every episode of Season One, but in no episodes of later seasons. Name these rooms.
<p align=left>

The correct answers are:<br>
The Tomb of Ancient Kings and the Cave of Sighs<p align=left>

<b>Question 16:<br></b>
Name any room of the temple (other than the Jester's Court or a Pit room) from which a temple guard never emerged.<p align=left>

The correct answers are:<br>
The Well, the Viper's Nest, or the Spider's Lair.<p align=left>

<b>Question 17:<br></b>
Name a room of the temple that had one actuator.<p align=left>

The correct answers are:<br>
The Dungeon or the Quicksand Bog. If you answered the Well or the Mine Shaft, you get half credit because while these rooms had one door actuator, they also had two actuators on their respective elevators.<p align=left>

<b>Question 18:<br></b>
There was only one episode where a player was removed from the temple in one of the two entrance rooms. Name this episode.<p align=left>

The correct answer is:<br>
The Walking Stick of Harriet Tubman<p align=left>

<b>Question 19:<br></b>
Complete the following sequence: The Torch Room, The Observatory, The Shrine of the Silver Monkey, The Room of the Golden Idols, -------?<p align=left>

The correct answers are:<br>
The Swamp or The Wall Climb<p align=left>
The order goes as the number of exits that room had, and applicable only to rooms present in the first season. If you answered The Spider's Lair, you get half credit because the corner doors really weren't accessible.<p align=left>

Are you ready for the bonus question?<p align=left>

The correct answer is:<br>
Yes<p align=left>

<b>BONUS:<br></b>

The correct answers are:<br>
In layouts 6-9 of Season 1, and every layout in Season 2.<p align=left>

Surprisingly enough, when the Wheel Room was first introduced in Layout 5, Olmec still announced the rooms in a counter-clockwise order.<p align=left>
