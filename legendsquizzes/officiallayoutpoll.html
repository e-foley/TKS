<p class="title">Official Nicklegends Layout Poll</span>

<p class="header">
The website will celebrate its third birthday in just ten days! For a bit of an early birthday present, I wanted to redo the styling of each of the pages now that I have the knowledge and experience to do so (besides, I've received a lot of complaints about the orange background color).

<p class="subheader">
Vote below on the page style you would like to keep. Be aware, the voting console will only accept one vote from each IP address. (Vote to see the results--I don't want anybody else's opinion to sway YOUR decision!)

<p align="center">
<table class="linktable">
<tr>
<td class="headercell">Choose the better layout!</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="desccell"><input type="radio" name="layout" checked> <b>></b> New layout (as you see on this page)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="desccell"><input type="radio" name="layout"> <b>></b> Old layout (the orangey one)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><center><input type="button" value="Cast Vote" onClick="window.location.href='layoutresults.html'"></td>
</tr></table>
