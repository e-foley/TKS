<b>BONUS:<br></b>
Let's say for a moment that you are on the show and make it to Olmec's temple. You volunteer to go first into the temple, and your goal is to reach the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. You decide to follow the bottom route of the temple, passing through the Laser Light Room and the Swamp on your way. You make it all the way to the Mine Shaft, where you then take the elevator upwards. Once you step out of the elevator, you have no idea where you are. What specifically must you do in this room to gain access to the Shrine of the Silver Monkey? (No looking at the Temple Layouts section!)<p align=left>
The correct answer is:<br>
You must plug in four power cords into the central lightning ball to continue onwards.<p align=left>
You're in the Lightning Ball Room. Good job getting to the artifact solo!<p align=left>
