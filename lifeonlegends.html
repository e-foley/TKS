<dd>I awoke one morning to the sound of my mother calling "Zac. Levi. Time
to get up boys." As my younger brother climbed down off the top bunk I
gave him a playful shove. He took a swing, but continued out to the
bathroom. I climbed out of bed and walked to the kitchen to great my
parents.
<dd>This morning, something was different, my dad was holding a newspaper
and grinning at me. I looked over and mom had mirrored his grin. I
wondered what was going on. "How would you like to be on TV?" my
father asked.
<dd>In my typical, cautious, 13 year old manner I answered, "Why?" There
was a hesitation.
<dd>"Wait  for your brother to get out of the bathroom and we'll tell
you." I waited and started into my bowl of Lucky Charms. "The
newspaper says that tomorrow they will be holding auditions at
Nickelodeon Studios to be on a game show."
<dd>"I want to be on GUTS!" my brother shouted.
<dd>"This one is for Legends of the Hidden Temple, do you know which one that is?"
<dd>Cocky as always I answered, "Of course, it's the one with the big
talking rock and the maze." When I visualized Omec the talking rock,
the idea began to grow in my mind. "Do you think we can get on?"
<dd>"You boys are both smart and athletic, it should be a sure thing." Dad
began to pat my back, and at that moment I knew we would definitely be
attending the auditions tomorrow.
<dd>We had just moved down from Kennett Square, Pennsylvania to
Casselberry FL in the summer of 93. My father was a civilian dentist
who signed a contract to work on the Orlando Navy Base.  By the fall,
my brother and I had become adjusted to our new town and made our
friends at South Seminole Middle School. In the back our my mind I
thought about how cool I would be if my class mates saw me on TV.
On Saturday morning, my father roused us, cooked us a good breakfast
and drove us to the Universal Studios back lot. We followed the signs
and came to the warehouse where the auditions were held. It was a cool
October morning, but still muggy because of the FL humidity.
<dd>When we arrived, they handlers gave my brother and I numbers and sent
us from station to station. Our first station was the history test. We
sat down at a table with 10 or so other children and a proctor came
and delivered the 50 question test. We had both been exceptional
students, so when the tests were graded at the end of the half hour,
both Levi and I had passed the 80% correct requirement. Half of us
children tested were moved on while the others were sent back toward
the door.
<dd>The next section was the physical tests. First we had to do pull-ups.
The bald man in a black shirt simply told us, "Do as many as you can."
Most of the girls did about 5. Levi did 12. There was a jock-bully
looking kid there who did 20. Myself being a bit of a show off did 24.
Take that larger bully!
<d>Next was a shuttle run, but instead of just touching the ground, we
raced from one end of the path to the other and picked up a rubber
chicken. Once we got it back to the start we turned and ran down
again. I don't remember my exact time, but the producers seemed
excited about my speed. My brother was a few seconds shy of my score.
<dd>From there we went on to try one of their challenges. There sat before
us was two circles of the Legends of the Hidden Temple Insignia both
turned from the ground at funny angles. The object was to run on them
for as long as possible and see how many rotations you could get in 2
minutes without falling off. At this point the audition seemed to turn
more to a game than a competition. All of us kids laughed as we tried
to stay on and run.
<dd>With the physical activities done, we were ushered to a line, waiting
for interviews with the producers. I remember watching some of the
kids sitting there being quiet. I told my brother, "Levi, they want to
make sure we are fun people 'cause they only want fun people on the
show, so smile and talk back." Levi was always the shy child of the
family. When it came our turn, the producers asked us typical child
questions. What do you want to be when you grow up? What is your
favorite cartoon? What do you do for fun? When we finished, I shook
the mans hand and the handler took us back to our father. At that
point, I knew I had made the show.
<dd>For the next month, we watched the show daily to figure out the
tricks. I was always afraid of the "Shrine of the Silver Monkey" room
since that seemed to be most contestant's downfall. At the end of
november, my mom came running to the living room after getting off of
the phone and said told us "I have good news. Both of you boys made it
onto the show!"
<dd>When word got around school that Levi and I were to be TV stars, we
were approached by a lanky brown haired boy named Josh Seniscalco. He
told us that he was on the first season, and got to the final  maze,
but didn't make it to the end in time. He became our unofficial tutor.
<dd>However he didn't really tell us anything that we couldn't guess from
just watching the show. When January rolled around, he spent the night
at my house before my day of taping.
<dd>My day was taped on a Wed, so I remember being glad that I was also
missing class to film. We showed up at 6:30 in the morning at the back
lots of Universal Studios. There we met a young black women who was
our handler. She introduced us to our partners. Mine was Myriam, a
very cute girl from Appopka. After us kids and our parents met, the
adults were lead off to a conference room in another building. We were
told they couldn't be in the audience because they didn't want them
yelling or intimidating the kids. They instead watched the whole thing
from a closed circuit TV.
<dd>From there we were broken up into shows and it was explained to us
that 5 shows were filmed a day. All of the moat crossings were filmed
at once. All of the steps at once. Etc.. If we didn't make it to the
next round, our parents were called from the other building to pick us
up to take us home. Each 5 group of show contestants were given our
own makeup rooms to hang out in. Here we got to know each other.
<dd>The handler came and took us to wardrobe. The team shirts were handed
out arbitrarily. I remember not wanting to be a Purple Parrot. They
mentioned that everyone got to take home the shirt except the silver
snakes because our shirts were special because they had to re-color
the snake so it would show up better on film. They would give us
uncolored normal shirts at the end though. Since our first challenge
was the moat crossing, we were given aquasocks.  From there they led
us to the set. When we entered the audience cheered. I thought it was
the coolest thing in the world to be cheered on like that. It was
there that Kirk Fogg introduced himself to us and told us that our show
was "The Secret Map of the Bandit Queen."
<dd>For our moat crossing challenge the boys had to jump in and paddle a
large piece of styrofoam across while our team member had to balance.
If she fell off we had to go back to the beginning and start again.
The trick was that we weren't allowed to push off the walk or walk
along the bottom. Myriam and I's plan was for me to go slow and steady
and for her to balance in the center.
<dd>Before we started the show opened up and it was explained that they
would show us all before we started. I told her we needed to do
something cool, so when the camera came to us, we head butted. It was
a pretty weak intimidation factor. When we started I jumped into the
water and was surprised that it was nice and warm. When the
competition started, Myriam seemed to be having trouble balancing
right off of the bat. She fell off twice quickly. Two teams had made
it across and the third was on their way. At this point she got her
head in the game and focused. We knew that if she fell off again we
would have been over taken and had to go home, so she really worked
her balance. When we made it across she reached down to help pull me
out, but I knew I could jump out quicker. I popped out of the water
and ran and hit my gong as quickly as I could. We had made it.
<dd>Since we were the 4th team, Kirk came over and stood by us to segue
into the next segment. Cameras stopped rolling and we were ushered
back to our rooms to wait for the next part. Here Russell and I hit it
off fairly well. He was the boy on the Red Jaguars.  He explained to
me that he was 15 and that the age limit for the show was 14, but that
since he was 14 at the time of the audition that he was allowed on
anyways. His team member Jackie was originally a replacement, but the
first girl got sick and Jackie got her place. She was pretty quiet and
moody the whole time. According to my dad her parents kept yelling
"smile Jackie!" in the annexed room.
<dd>A couple hours later, the handler came back and explained to us how
the stairs work. She first read the story to us in our makeup room.
After that she said that only one contestant on the team will be
mircophoned. Since it was obvious that I was the leader, Myriam said I
should take it. At this point the voice of Omec came in and
introduced himself, he was a really nice guy. I had recognized him as
playing an elf in a KFC commercial. He wanted to be sure that he was
pronouncing our names right.
<dd>When it came time for our stairs, we were marched out and again
greeted by an audience. Omec re-read the story to us and the questions
began. I was quick on the draw and stomped my buzzer the quickest
every time. We made it down to the bottom first. Once down I started
to cheer for Russell since he seemed cool. There were some questions
that the other teams couldn't answer, so if there was no effect to the
game, they were just cut out of the show. It came down to the Red
Jaguars and us.
<dd>We were taken back and given a lunch break. All the teams at this
point were allowed to meet now and we ate together in the green room.
I remember a blond on one of the other shows that I thought was really
pretty. From here this point we were allowed to walk from room to room
and talk to them as they waited for their shows to be filmed to. Our
handler briefed us on the rules that we weren't allowed to talk smack,
cheat, or bully each other or we would be kicked off the show. At this
point Russell started running his mouth back in the dressing room.
"You don't have a chance at beating me. You're a pipsqueek." I was
used to being under estimated because of my size my whole life. I
liked being underestimated, because it gave me the advantage of
surprize.
<dd>I didn't tell on him or talk smack back. I simply replied, "we'll
see," and nodded my head.  When it came to my competition for the half
Pendant of Life, we were led to a large vertical maze. We started at
the top and had to wind our way through with a rope. Once we got out,
we had to pull the rope attached to a bag of jewels out. I knew that
climbing is my strongest ability and that tunneling through a maze
would use similar skills. As it started I burrowed my way through,
knocking foam rocks out of the way. I had no clue how Russell was
doing. I just kept pushing it. I got to the end and pulled as quickly
as I could until I got the bag out. When they sounded the buzzer, I
didn't know if I had won or if he had. I went around front to check
and saw that I had my rope and bag out before he had even gotten his
way out of the maze. That felt great. However it needed to feel great
on film, so they re-threaded the rope through and had me pull it out
again and celebrate in victory. Russell shook my hand and didn't look
me in the eyes.
<dd>When it came time for Myriam's competition, she and Jackie were asked
to sit on heavy bags connected to bungie cords. The workers pumped at
a lever which shook the bags like bucking broncos. The object was to
hang on as tight as possible. Whoever fell off the least won. From the
start of the competition it was clear that Myriam had the advantage.
She had been a dancer and seemed to possess the natural rhythm needed
to stay on. Jackie fell off 5 times before Myriam fell off once at the
very end.
<dd>The next competition was the team competition for a whole pendent. If
we won, we went into the temple with 2 lives. If we lost it went to a
tie breaker. We were placed in harnesses and connected through a
climbing maze that we had to work though bars and obstacles on
opposite sides at the same time. Finally climbing, I knew we'd rock
this. However because my waist was so small they couldn't fit the
harness to me correctly and just tied it with a hand knot. Right off
the bat when the buzzer sounded and we started climbing, my harness
began to slip off. There were points where it dangled from my feet and
I had to pull it back up to continue while Russell and Jackie finished
unhindered. I was pretty upset, but knew that complaining would do no
good.
<dd>It came down to that dreaded tie breaker. I thought ahead about how
much quicker my reflexes were than Russell's in the stairs of
knowledge test. I knew that it wasn't about knowing the answer first,
it was about ringing in first. As soon as Omec finished the question I
rang in and stuttered out my answer "Half of the gold, or the reward-
the treasure." It was accepted, but Russell and Jackie's parents
apparently made a scene in the room with the other adults claiming
that it wasn't fair because I didn't say treasure first. Their
complaints were ignored and we went on to the temple maze.
<dd>Back in our makeup room, Myriam and I were given copies of the map. We
didn't know which ways would be open but it showed which rooms were
connected. Myriam complained that she didn't want to go into the Dark
Forrest because she was afraid of getting caught there. I told her
that if it opens up that way she'll have to go in. I realized the
smartest thing to do would be to send her in first and get her out of
my way so I could rush in and do what needs to be done. I explained it
to her differently.
<dd>It was after 11 at night now and we were tired, but excited. They took
us back to the set, but this time since Universal Theme Park was
closed, there was no audience and the sound would be added. in. The
buzzer started and Myriam headed in. She was going a bit slow for my
tastes and I kept hoping that a Temple Guard would grab her soon. By
the time she made it into the fifth room, The Jesters Court at 2
minutes, she waisted 30 seconds by hitting the wrong buttons. When she
finally corrected herself, she opened up the Dark Forrest. Afraid to
go in, she headed back to the beginning as I screamed at her "what are
you doing! You have to go that way." She turned back and was captured
with a minute and fifteen seconds left.
<dd>I just put myself into a mental state of passion and rage. I tore
through the maze at full speed, jumping off 2nd stories instead of
climbing down. I needed to make up the time she lost. I ran full speed
into the dark forrest and broke through a wall without even thinking
about doing it. After neither door in the pit opened I figured it was
supposed to be a dead end, so I decided to think out of the box and
went up the slide that was slicked to keep people down. Luckily I had
a strong grip. I made it up through the Tomb of the Secret Password
and into the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. I was thankful that the map
was there because I knew that I wouldn't have time to put the monkey
together and get out. When I grabbed the map I went full speed through
the temple to the exit and jumped down the stairs with 6 seconds to
spare.
<dd>Kirk seemed to be more excited that I was which was cool. Everyone
came out and congratulated me because no one thought I had enough time
to get in and out. One of the producers even checked the time sheets
and said that I had crushed the fastest time that one person had been
in and out. I had won the TV, the Videogame Chair, and the Vacation to
Santa Monica, CA. They brought out my dad and Myriam's parents. We
hugged and went home at midnight.
<dd>The next day was my brothers filming. Since other families brought
more than one parent the first day to watch, this day my mom and I
also accompanied my dad. We went to a room much like a business office
with a long conference table and a TV at the end. We watched my
brother in The Marble Armrest of Xerxes. He wanted to win like I had
and get the family two vacations, but he ended up losing at the tie
breaker where I won. All together we came home with a color TV which I
still have today, his Judge Dredd video game for the Sega Genesis, My
videogame chair for the Sega Genesis (it was kinda cool because you
leaned it around to move the characters and hit buttons in the
handles, but lost it's novelty after a month), and out trip to
California. That vacation was one of the best one's we ever had.
<dd>Now with the TV show's I'm doing, it appears that I may have a firm
foot in the door of Hollywood, but I owe my first experience to a
giant talking rock. I wouldn't want it any other way.<p align=left>


<b><br>Temple Game Victor, Henry the Eighth's Great Seal, Season 1</b><p align=left>

"When I auditioned for legends there was a small advertisement in the Orlando 
Sentinel newspaper for auditions for a new action/adventure gameshow from 
nickelodeon. Once again, I was on the first season and had no idea what I 
was getting into. The audition was held in one of the nickelodeon sound 
stages on the univeral backlot and consisted of a timed obstacle course, 
then they counted how many pushups you could do and you took a written test 
(which had general knowledge and pop culture questions) they took your 
picture and you went on your way. I think it was quite a while before I 
heard from them.<p align=left>

I arrived to film my episode on August 10th 1993, I only remember the date 
because it was six days before my 13th birthday so I wanted to say I was 13 
in the interview since when the episode aired I would be 13. They filmed 
either 5 or 6 episodes the day I was there (It was a long time ago) I didn't 
realize how long of a day it would be. They don't film the shows all at once 
the film them one segment at a time. (moat, stairs, games, temple) When you 
watch the show it looks like after you finish the moat you turn around to 
the steps when actually it was at least a couple hours later. (notice 
everyone is dry)<p align=left>

The first thing in the morning they told all the parents they would have to 
spend the day in a seperate green room that had a video feed. There were no 
parents in the audience. They took us to a trailer and gave us a quick 
breakdown on how the game worked, as far as being an elimination. They then 
called out the names of the partners. Nobody knew each other prior to that 
day. We got our wardrobe, and no they weren't reebok sneakers they were 
k-mart crap and I was upset that there were no high tops left in my size. It 
didn't matter anyways we didn't keep anything except for our shirts. (Which 
I still have!)<p align=left>

We got to walk through the set for the first time. We then went in the back 
and had our mouthpieces fit. The moat was a breeze, however I do feel sorry 
for those who lose on it. It makes for a very sad experience. My whole goal 
for the day was to make it to the temple games so I would get to be 
interviewed. Anyways, a couple hours after we finished the moat we went in 
to go film the steps of knowledge, we were all wondering why they made us 
keep our helmets on, but as I said earlier it was for the illusion of 
continuity.<br>
Right before entering the sound stage for the steps, we got to meet dee 
baker the voice of Olmec. He was really funny and talented, he did several 
voices for us and explained that he pulled a wire to control olmec's mouth.
Once we started filming the steps it was the first time I actually saw kirk 
fogg, up until then I could only hear him. They did a very flatering job 
editing the steps, since the made it look like I breezed through all the 
questions when in actuality I rang in on a whole bunch more but they were 
wrong and no one else would ring in. I think that's why the questions were 
starting to get real easy, they were probably running out.
Those of us who made it passed the steps were lucky enough to get lunch. It 
was the Pizza Hut Bigfoot pizza which really never did settle very well.<p align=left>

When we were finally ready to film the temple games we got to meet kirk 
fogg. He went over what we were going to talk about in our interviews. I 
noticed in the later seasons they took this portion out all together. They 
showed us our temple games and we got to decide who wanted to do what. Of 
course we both wanted to slide around in the mr. bubbles trying to crown the 
mannequin heads. However we made the agreement that if I got to do the 
messy, more fun temple game then if we made it to the temple she could go 
first. (I never thought we would make it to the temple).<p align=left>

My temple game ended up in a tie (I couldn't even beat a girl) however when 
it was all done I knocked kirk fogg down while he was helping me up. He 
laughed it off on camera, but when they weren't filming you could tell he 
was upset that his shorts were all wet. My partner got beat in the bamboo 
forest by Jordan from the blue barricudas. (he was really cocky and made us 
winning that much more sweet) We somehow pulled off the final temple game 
and were on our way to the temple. We actually knew we won before Kirk said 
it, because the spotters were holding up the numbers of how many felt pieces 
we had on their hands. The shot of the spotters holding the pieces of felt 
that aired in the episode must have been filmed later.<p align=left>

They took all of us who made it to the temple for a tour of it. This was 
EXTREMELY overwhelming! Every room had a differant way of opening the doors 
and we were just trying to figure out the object of the temple. Even when I 
went in I still wasn't sure if the seal would be hidden in the room or not. 
I guess I had watched too much finders keepers. I also wasn't exactly sure 
what a seal looked like.<p align=left>

After the tour while we were in the greenroom they gave us a marker and a 
piece of paper with a map of the temple and its rooms. They encouraged us to 
map out a path. Both my partner and I agreed it was worthless considering 
that if one door didn't open the whole path would be worthless. We did 
however make our fatal mistake. We decided to enter in the cave of size. If 
you've seen my episode you can realize that there was no way for us to win 
once we made that choice.<p align=left>

Right before entering the temple we got to see what we've been waiting for, 
the prizes we were playing for. I'll tell you right now that if there was a 
camera on my face when the said our grand prize was a trip to busch gardens 
(60 miles away) it would have been priceless. Considering the show that 
filmed before us just won a trip to Jamaica!<br>
Prizes aside,  Shay went first and did an o.k. job, the when I heard Kirk 
tell me to go I was in a dream. It was bizarre as if I was sitting back 
watching myself do this, the whole surrealness of being the center of 
attention on a nickelodeon gameshow. Every room I entered all I remember 
thinking is "please no temple guard". My first embarassment came when I 
couldn't find the silver monkey. I actually looked in the cabinets. My final 
embarassment came at the end of my run when I was startled so badly by the 
temple guards that I jumped completely out of the temple. To this day I 
can't live that down.<p align=left>

There is life after legends though! I did have dreams for a month or two 
afterwards about going back on and actually winning. I do still think it was 
one of the best experiences of my life. Every part of it was a blast. I've 
come a long way from the nerdy 12 year old on the episode, but it's still 
cool to meet new friends who used to love legends and get a kick out of 
showing them my episode. I still am guarded about who I'll actually show it 
too, afterall I think anyone would agree it's not something I'd show anyone 
to impress them, but more to poke fun at myself and how young I was. My 
fiance always cracks up at my comment about the bungee cord being too short 
after my temple game.<p align=left>

Anyways now that I have major typing cramp. If you happen to have any 
questions about anything I said or might have left out, please e-mail me. I 
think your sites are great and look forward to showing them to my friends."<p align=left>

Best Wishes,<br>

"When I saw an [ad] in the paper for a try out for this one thing, I didn't
really look at it,but the one thing that caught my eye was it would be on
live TV. I asked my mom if I could try out. She said yes but don't be mad if
you don't make it. Then my dad said yes, but he said there will be hundreds
of people there. The try out was in one week so I had to train hard. First I
took out my soccer ball and started doing toe touches and popcorn
drills ([bouncing] the ball on your knees). After an hour a day each day my dad
took me to a work out gym ([you] didn't have to be 18 back then) where I would

go lift weights and do sit ups and push ups. There was a pool there too and
from the websites I looked on, you had to cross a moat. So I would do about
10 laps and get out. When I found out there was a Steps of [Knowledge] I kind
of got worried because I wasn't that good at ELA or Math. Then I found out
it was only about Social Studies. I had a A- in [Social]. Two days before the
tryout my dad took me to a rock climbing wall where I was ok at. Then the
day came...<p align=left>



My dad was right! There [were] hundreds of people there. Some you could tell
weren't going to make it because they were fat. First I had to go through an
[obstacle] course which I did pretty well on. Then we had to do push ups or
sit ups. I [chose] sit ups and did 47 (I think) in a minute. Then the written
test came... I thought I would do horrible on it. I only got [two] wrong! Then
the phone [rang] about three weeks later. My mom screamed then I heard her go
to my dad who gave a whoopee! Then my dad told me to come here and told me
the good news. I had made it!<p align=left>




It felt like forever before the day came. When it came I had been [assigned] to
the
Silver Snakes. Like another person had said before, [you] got K-Mart Crap. The
moat started and we weren't
in first. We finally rang in in third place. Then after [Kirk] announced the
crappy moat prize ([candy]) we were sent back to
the locker room. We said good-bye to the teams that didn't make it. The boys
that didn't make it were yelling at [their] girl partner
that they suck. The [girls] were crying because they didn't get to go on and
that they got candy (LoL). I talked to my partner
and asked her if she was good at social. She said yes. Two hours later we
went onto the Steps of [Knowledge]. I was so glad that we made it
passed the [dreaded] steps.<p align=left>



Then we went out to KFC which was ok. Kirk turned out to be a pretty nice
man.
I thought he would be so [greedy] because he was a TV Star. After [lunch] about
another
[two] hours we did the temple games. I won, my partner didn't. Then we won the
last game.
After I [heard] we were going to the temple I kind of got ######.Finally the
best part of all...
                                     THE                 TEMPLE<p align=left>



They gave us a sheet of paper and a marker to write out our [strategy]. We
also got to meet
Dee Bradley Baker, who is a really cool guy. ([That's] probably why he's played a
part in over 100 shows.)
Finally the temple run came. I thought I knew the temple gaurds were in the
[observatory] and crypt and [Medusa's Lair].
I didn't care about the clock. I was glad I took the ledges because the
gaurd was in the crypt. In the dark forest, I
was [careful] not to get caught. I actually thought I wasn't going to make it
until I raced down the [stairs]. My partner got in that girly girl
voice because we were going to go on a vacation.<p align=left>
